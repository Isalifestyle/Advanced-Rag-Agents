      "{'HCOT': {'HCOT_response': AIMessage(content=\"To provide an accurate and comprehensive answer to the query, I will break down the explanation into steps, considering the complexity of the topic and the potential for human feedback.\\n\\n### Step 1: Definition of Cancer\\n- **Cancer** is a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. It can occur in almost any part of the body and is one of the leading causes of death worldwide.\\n\\n### Step 2: Understanding How Cancer Works\\n- **Cell Division and Mutation**: Normally, cells in the body grow, divide, and die in a controlled manner. However, sometimes this process goes wrong, leading to abnormal cell growth. This can occur due to mutations in the DNA of the cells, which can be caused by various factors such as genetics, environmental exposures (like tobacco smoke and UV radiation), and viral infections.\\n- **Tumor Formation**: When a cell becomes cancerous, it begins to grow uncontrollably and can form a tumor. Tumors can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Malignant tumors are capable of invading neighboring tissues and spreading to other parts of the body through the bloodstream or lymphatic system, a process known as metastasis.\\n\\n### Step 3: Types of Cancer\\n- There are many types of cancer, which are typically classified based on the type of cell or the organ where the cancer begins. Major categories include:\\n  - **Carcinomas**, which start in the skin or the lining of organs (such as breast, lung, colon, and prostate cancer).\\n  - **Sarcomas**, which begin in the connective tissue (like bone, cartilage, and fat).\\n  - **Leukemias**, which start in the blood-forming tissue (such as bone marrow) and cause large numbers of abnormal blood cells to be produced.\\n  - **Lymphomas**, which start in the cells of the lymph system (part of the immune system).\\n  - **Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors**, which start in the tissues of the brain and spinal cord.\\n\\n### Step 4: Consideration of Human Feedback\\nSince no specific human feedback has been provided in this context, it's essential to keep the explanation broad and inclusive, covering the basic aspects of cancer and how it works. If specific feedback were provided, such as questions about a particular type of cancer or the effects of cancer on certain populations, the explanation could be tailored to address those concerns directly.\\n\\n### Step 5: Conclusion and Additional Information\\n- Cancer is a complex and multifaceted group of diseases, with various forms and stages. Understanding the basics of cancer, including its causes, how it progresses, and the different types, is crucial for prevention, early detection, and treatment.\\n- Advances in medical science and technology have led to improved treatments and survival rates for many types of cancer. However, cancer remains a significant health challenge worldwide, underscoring the need for continued research, education, and awareness.\\n\\n### Final Answer\\nCancer is a disease characterized by the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the body, which can invade and destroy surrounding tissues and spread to other parts of the body. It arises from mutations in cell DNA, which can be caused by genetic, environmental, and viral factors. There are many types of cancer, each with its own set of characteristics, challenges, and treatment approaches.

In other words, disease may be defined as a disorder in the physical,\\nphysiological, psychological or social state of a person caused due to nutritional\\ndeficiency, physiological disorder, genetic disorder, pathogen or any other reason.\\n29.1.1 Types of Diseases\\nThe diseases may be classified into two broad categories (Table 29.1).\\nTable 29.1 Classification of human diseases\\nDiseases\\nCongenital diseases\\nAcquired diseases\\n(Present since birth)\\n(Develop after birth)\\nCommunicable diseases\\nNon-communicable diseases\\n(Spread from infected person\\n(do not spread from a diseased person\\nto healthy person\\nto a healthy person)\\nDegenerative\\nDeficiency\\nAllergies\\nCancer\\nOther diseases\\ndiseases\\ndiseases\\n(caused due to\\n(caused due to\\n(caused due to\\n(caused due to\\n(caused due to\\nhypersensitivity uncontrolled\\nvarious physical\\nmalfunctioning\\nlack of nutrients of the body to\\ngrowth of cells/\\nagents or any\\nof vital body\\nin diet)\\ncertain foreign\\ntissues)\\nother reason)\\norgan)\\nsubstances)\\nA. Congenital disease : The disease which is present from birth (e.g. hole in the\\nheart in infants). They are caused by some genetic abnormality or metabolic\\ndisorder or malfunctioning of an organ.\\nB. Acquired disease : The disease which may occur after birth during one’s\\nlifetime.\\nAcquired diseases may generally be classified into :\\n(i)\\nInfectious diseases : The diseases which can be transmitted from diseased\\nhealthy person person to e.g. measles.\\n(ii) Degenerative diseases : The diseases caused by the malfunction of some vital\\norgans of the body e.g. heart failure.', 'Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 266\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\n(iii) Deficiency diseases : These are caused due to nutritional deficiency such as\\nthat of minerals or vitamins in the diet e.g. anaemia (Fe), Beri- beri (vitamin\\nB). You have read about such diseases in an earlier lesson 27.\\n(iv) Cancer : This is an abnormal, uncontrolled and unwanted growth of cells. e.g.\\nbreast cancer.\\nAcquired diseases are studied under two categories (Table 29.2).\\n(i)\\nCommunicable diseases : The diseases which can be transmitted from\\nan infected person to a healthy person.\\n(ii)\\nNon-communicable diseases : These diseases do not spread from an\\naffected person to a healthy person.\\nTable 29.2 Differences between communicable and\\nnon-communicable diseases\\nCommunicable diseases\\nNon-communicable diseases\\n1.

The concern of the diseases involves\\nthe society as these are related to\\ncommunity health.\\n29.1.2 Modes of Spread of Communicable  Diseases\\nCommunicable diseases spread from the infected person to a healthy person in the\\nfollowing ways.\\nDirect transmission\\nThe pathogens of diseases infect a healthy person directly without an intermediate\\nagent. It can take place by various means such as,\\n(i)\\nDirect contact between the infected person and the healthy person :\\nDiseases like small pox, chicken pox, syphilis, gonorrhoea spread through direct\\ncontact.\\n(ii) Droplet infection : The infected person throws out tiny droplets of mucus by\\ncoughing, sneezing or spitting. These droplets may contain the pathogen. By\\ninhaling the air containing the droplets, a healthy person may get the infection.\\nDiseases like common cold, pneumonia, influenza, measles, tuberculosis and\\nwhooping cough spread through droplet infection.\\nCaused due to some specific factor,\\nsuch as malfunctioning of some vital\\norgan, and deficiency of nutrients.\\nDo not spread from one person to\\nanother by contact.\\nThe concern of the disease is restricted\\nto the individual only.', 'Some Common Human Diseases\\n 267\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\n(iii) Contact with soil contaminated with disease-causing viruses and bacteria.\\n(iv) Animal bite : Viruses of rabies are introduced through the wound caused by\\nthe bite of rabid animals, especially dogs. The virus is present in the saliva of\\nthe rabid animals.\\nIndirect transmission\\nThe pathogens of certain diseases reach the human body through some intermediate\\nagents. It can take place by various means, which are as follows :\\n(i)\\nBy vectors such as houseflies, mosquitoes, and cockroaches. Examples:\\nHouseflies carry the causative organisms of cholera on their legs and mouth\\nparts from the faeces and sputum of infected persons to food and drinks and\\ncontaminate them. When this contaminated food is taken by a healthy person,\\nhe gets the infection. Similarly, mosquitoes carry virus of dengue and malarial\\nparasite which causes malaria.\\n(ii) Air-borne : The pathogens may reach humans with air and dust. The epidemic\\ntyphus spreads by inhalation of dried faeces of infected fly.\\n(iii) Object borne (Fonite borne) : Many diseases are transmitted through the use\\nof contaminated articles, such as clothes, utensils, toys, door handles, taps,\\nsyringes and surgical instruments.\\n(iv) Water borne : If potable water (drinking water) is contaminated with\\npathogens of diseases such as cholera, diarhhoea, hepatitis or jaundice, it\\nreaches a healthy person upon consuming such water.\\n29.2 SOME IMPORTANT TERMS TO REMEMBER\\nPathogen : A living organism which causes a disease.\\nParasite : An organism which gets food and shelter from host.\\nHost : The living body on or inside which the disease-producing organism takes\\nshelter.\\nInfestation : Presence of a large number of parasitic organisms on the surface of\\nbody of the host or on the clothings.\\nVector : It is an organism which harbours a pathogen and may pass it on to another\\nperson to cause a disease (Mosquitoes harbour malarial parasite and transmits it\\nto humans).\\nCarrier : It is an organism which itself does not harbour the pathogen but physically\\ntransmits it to another person (Housefly is the carrier of cholera germs).\\nReservoir : An organism which harbours pathogens in large numbers that do not\\ncause any suffering to it.\\nEpidemic : Spreading of a disease among a large number of people causing a huge\\nloss of life in the same place for some time e.g. plague.\\nEndemic : A disease which is regularly found among a particular group of people\\ne.g. goitre, restricted to a certain locality or a country.', 'Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 268\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nPandemic : A disease which is found all over the world e.g. AIDS.\\nInterferon : Type of proteins produced by infected cells of the body when attacked\\nby a virus, which act to prevent the further development of the same virus.\\nInoculation : Introduction of antigenic material inside the body to prevent suffering\\nfrom a disease.\\nVaccination : Injection of a weak strain of a specific bacterium (Vaccine) in order\\nto secure immunity against the corresponding disease. It is also called immunisation.\\nIncubation period : The period between entry of pathogen inside a healthy body\\nand appearance of the symptoms of the disease.\\nSymptoms : Specific morphological or physiological expressions which appear on\\nthe deseased organism and help in the identification of the disease.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 29.1\\n1.

Influenza\\nInfluenza, commonly known as ‘flu’ is an illness caused by viruses that infect the\\nrespiratory tract. Compared to common cold, influenza is a more severe illness.\\nCauses\\nInfluenza is caused by a virus which attacks our body’s cells, resulting in various\\neffects depending on the strain of the virus.', 'Some Common Human Diseases\\n 271\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nThere are many strains of influenza virus. The virus mutates all the time and new\\nvariations (strains) arise. This constant changing enables the virus to evade the\\nimmune system of its host. Unfortunately immunity against one strain (which is\\nconferred by exposure or immunisation) does not protect against other strains. A\\nperson infected with influenza virus develops antibodies against that virus; as the\\nvirus changes, the antibodies against the virus do not recognize the changed virus,\\nand influenza can recur, caused by the changed or mutated virus.\\nSymptoms\\nTypical symptoms of influenza include:\\n(i)\\nfever (Usually 100° F to 103° F in adults and often even higher in children).\\n(ii) respiratory tract infection symptoms such as, cough, sore throat, running\\nnose, headache, pain in the muscles, and extreme fatigue.\\nAlthough nausea and vomiting and diarrhoea can sometimes accompany Influenza\\ninfection, especially in children, gastrointestinal symptoms are rarely prominent.\\nMost people who get flu, recover completely in 1 to 2 weeks, but some people\\ndevelop serious and potentially life-threatening complications, such as pneumonia.\\nTreatment and Control\\n(i) Much of the illness and death caused by influenza can be prevented by annual\\ninfluenza vaccination. Influenza vaccine is specifically recommended for those\\nwho are at high risk for complications with chronic diseases of the heart, lungs\\nor kidneys, diabetes, or severe forms of anaemia.\\n(ii) The persons suffering from influenza should\\nz\\ndrink plenty of fluids\\nz\\ntake symptom relief with paracetamol, aspirin (not in children under the\\nage of 16) or ibuprofen as recommended by the doctor.\\nz\\nConsult doctor immediately for treatment.\\n7. Dengue\\nDengue is an acute fever caused by virus. It is of two types: (i) Dengue fever, (ii)\\nDengue hemorrhagic fever.\\nDengue fever is characterized by an onset of sudden high fever, severe headache,\\npain behind the eyes and in the muscles and joints.\\nDengue hemorrhagic fever is an acute infectious viral disease. It is an advanced\\nstage of dengue fever. It is characterized by fever during the initial phase and other\\nsymptoms like headache, pain in the eye, joint pain and muscle pain, followed by\\nsigns of bleeding, red tiny spots on the skin, and bleeding from nose and gums.\\nHow does Dengue spread?\\nDengue spreads through the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito. The\\ntransmission of the disease occurs when a mosquito bites an infected person and\\nsubsequently bites a healthy person. In doing so, it transmits blood containing the', 'Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 272\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nvirus to the healthy person and the person becomes infected with dengue. The first\\nsymptoms of the disease occur about 5 to 7 days after the infected bite.\\nAedes mosquito rests indoors, in closets and other dark places, and is active during\\nday time. Outside, it rests where it is cool and shaded. The female mosquito lays\\nher eggs in stagnant water containers such as coolers, tyres, empty buckets, in and\\naround homes, and other areas in towns or villages. These eggs become adults in\\nabout 10 days.\\nIncubation period\\nThe time between the bite of a mosquito carrying dengue virus and the start of\\nsymptoms averages 4 to 6 days, with a range of 3 to 14 days.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is made through blood tests by scanning for antibodies against dengue\\nviruses. In addition the blood platelet counts also get drastically reduced in the\\ninfected person.\\nSymptoms\\nSymptoms of Dengue fever\\n(i)\\nSudden onset of high fever, generally 104-105 °F (40 °C), which may last 4-\\n5 days.\\n(ii)\\nSevere headache mostly in the forehead.\\n(iii) pain in the joints and muscles, body aches.\\n(iv) Pain behind the eyes which worsens with eye movement.\\n(v)\\nNausea or vomiting.\\nSymptoms of Dengue hemorrhagic fever\\nThese include symptoms similar to dengue fever, plus other symptoms such as:\\n(i)\\nSevere and continuous pain in the abdomen.\\n(ii)\\nRashes on the skin.\\n(iii) Bleeding from the nose, mouth, or in the internal organs.\\n(iv) Frequent vomiting with or without blood.\\n(v)\\nBlack stools due to internal bleeding.\\n(vi) Excessive thirst (dry mouth).\\n(vii) Pale, cold skin, weakness.\\nPrevention\\nFollowing steps can be taken to prevent spread of dengue fever:\\n(i)\\nAvoid water stagnation for more than 72 hours so that the mosquitoes do not\\nbreed there.\\n(ii)\\nPrevent mosquito breeding in stored water bodies, like ponds, and wells.', 'Some Common Human Diseases\\n 273\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\n(iii) Destroy discarded objects like old tyres and bottles, as they collect and store\\nrain water.\\n(iv) Use mosquito repellents and wear long sleeved clothes to curtail exposure.\\n(v)\\nUse mosquito nets, also during daytime.\\n(vi) Avoid outdoor activities during dawn or dusk when these mosquitoes are most\\nactive.\\n(vii) Patients suffering from dengue fever must be isolated for at least 5 days.\\n(viii) Report to the nearest health centre for any suspected case of Dengue fever.\\nTreatment for dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever\\nThere is no specific treatment for dengue fever. Persons with dengue fever should\\nrest and drink plenty of fluids. Dengue hemorrhagic fever is treated by replacing\\nlost fluids. Some patients need blood transfusions to control bleeding.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 29.2\\n1.

A\\npharmaceutical preparation or a naturally occurring substance used primarily to alter\\nthe physical or mental functioning of an individual, is called a drug.\\nWhat is drug abuse\\nWhen drugs are taken for medical reasons to treat or cure disease both physical\\nand mental, they are called medications or therapeutic drugs.\\nDrug abuse occurs when drugs are taken without medical reasons and without\\nmedical supervision, especially when they are taken in an amount, strength,\\nfrequency, or manner that damages the physical and mental functioning of the\\nindividual. Cough syrups, pain killers, and tranquillizers are some common medicines\\nthat are often abused.', 'Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 286\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nDrug abuse also occurs when certain chemicals that have no medical use or benefits\\nare taken, such as sniffing glue and solvents. The extent of drug abuse depends on\\nthe quantity of the drug being taken, and the method and frequency of its\\nconsumption. Drug abuse leads to many serious physical, emotional, and social\\nproblems.\\nWhat are the effects of drug abuse?\\nDrug abuse leads to a number of short-term and long-term effects that are\\ndetrimental to health:\\nz\\nShort-term effects : These are the effects that appear instantly or a few minutes\\nafter the intake of drugs. The effects include a sense of well-being and a pleasant\\ndrowsiness.\\nz\\nLong-term effects :  Constant and excessive use of drugs over a long period\\ncan cause both physical and mental damage and illness. This includes failure in\\nacademic studies, employment, and interpersonal relationship; financial ruin;\\nincreased risk of contracting STIs; and increased risk of being involved in\\nvehicular accidents. Addicts stop thinking of everything in life except when and\\nhow they will get their next drug dose. They will do anything for the dose,\\nincluding committing crimes such as theft and in certain case even murder.\\nSome Basic Facts\\nTeenagers sometimes try a smoke or drink just to see how it\\nfeels, but they do not start using drugs on a regular basis. What\\nis the harm in trying drugs just to see how it feels?\\nIdeally, there is no need to try out a smoke or drink.\\nBut there is a great difference between “ trying out” smoking  or\\ndrinking as compared to drugs.\\nSmoking and drinking once only or very occasionally does not\\nalways lead to addiction. But drugs are very powerful chemicals that\\ncan cause profound alterations in the metabolism of the  body and\\nin the chemistry of the brain. Even a single dose of a powerful drug\\ncan start the addiction process. When one’s mind and body becomes\\naddicted to drugs, stopping drugs produces very unpleasant and\\ndistressing mental and physical symptoms. This makes the addict\\npersist with the usage of the drug. Addicts cannot give up their habit\\nunless they get medical treatment and counselling.\\nYou should not boast about your strong will power and assume that\\nyou can experiment with drugs without becoming addicted. ALWAYS\\nKEEP AWAY from drugs. Do not allow yourself to succumb to\\npressure by friends and acquaintances. If you remain firm in your\\nresolve, you can prevent your life from being ruined.', 'Some Common Human Diseases\\n 287\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nSome Basic Facts\\nWhat are Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs)?\\nRTIs are infections of the upper and lower reproductive tracts of\\nboth sexes. Agents of infection include bacteria, viruses, and\\nprotozoa. Not all RTIs are sexually transmitted; some may occur\\ndue to an imbalance of the bacteria normally found in the reproductive\\ntract and poor personal hygiene.\\nSome Basic Facts\\nIs it possible for a person to have an RTI (Reproductive  Tract\\nInfection) without knowing about it?\\nSymptoms of RTIs in men are visible, and hence they become aware\\nthat their sexual organs have been infected.\\nHowever, RTIs in women sometimes can be asymptomatic. This\\nmeans that signs or symptoms are not experienced even though the\\ninfection is active. Hence women often do not know that they have\\nRTI.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 29.7\\n1.

Unfortunately immunity against one strain (which is\\nconferred by exposure or immunisation) does not protect against other strains. A\\nperson infected with influenza virus develops antibodies against that virus; as the\\nvirus changes, the antibodies against the virus do not recognize the changed virus,\\nand influenza can recur, caused by the changed or mutated virus.\\nSymptoms\\nTypical symptoms of influenza include:\\n(i)\\nfever (Usually 100° F to 103° F in adults and often even higher in children).\\n(ii) respiratory tract infection symptoms such as, cough, sore throat, running\\nnose, headache, pain in the muscles, and extreme fatigue.\\nAlthough nausea and vomiting and diarrhoea can sometimes accompany Influenza\\ninfection, especially in children, gastrointestinal symptoms are rarely prominent.\\nMost people who get flu, recover completely in 1 to 2 weeks, but some people\\ndevelop serious and potentially life-threatening complications, such as pneumonia.\\nTreatment and Control\\n(i) Much of the illness and death caused by influenza can be prevented by annual\\ninfluenza vaccination. Influenza vaccine is specifically recommended for those\\nwho are at high risk for complications with chronic diseases of the heart, lungs\\nor kidneys, diabetes, or severe forms of anaemia.\\n(ii) The persons suffering from influenza should\\nz\\ndrink plenty of fluids\\nz\\ntake symptom relief with paracetamol, aspirin (not in children under the\\nage of 16) or ibuprofen as recommended by the doctor.\\nz\\nConsult doctor immediately for treatment.\\n7. Dengue\\nDengue is an acute fever caused by virus. It is of two types: (i) Dengue fever, (ii)\\nDengue hemorrhagic fever.\\nDengue fever is characterized by an onset of sudden high fever, severe headache,\\npain behind the eyes and in the muscles and joints.\\nDengue hemorrhagic fever is an acute infectious viral disease. It is an advanced\\nstage of dengue fever. It is characterized by fever during the initial phase and other\\nsymptoms like headache, pain in the eye, joint pain and muscle pain, followed by\\nsigns of bleeding, red tiny spots on the skin, and bleeding from nose and gums.\\nHow does Dengue spread?\\nDengue spreads through the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito. The\\ntransmission of the disease occurs when a mosquito bites an infected person and\\nsubsequently bites a healthy person. In doing so, it transmits blood containing the'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 272\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nvirus to the healthy person and the person becomes infected with dengue. The first\\nsymptoms of the disease occur about 5 to 7 days after the infected bite.\\nAedes mosquito rests indoors, in closets and other dark places, and is active during\\nday time. Outside, it rests where it is cool and shaded. The female mosquito lays\\nher eggs in stagnant water containers such as coolers, tyres, empty buckets, in and\\naround homes, and other areas in towns or villages. These eggs become adults in\\nabout 10 days.\\nIncubation period\\nThe time between the bite of a mosquito carrying dengue virus and the start of\\nsymptoms averages 4 to 6 days, with a range of 3 to 14 days.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is made through blood tests by scanning for antibodies against dengue\\nviruses. In addition the blood platelet counts also get drastically reduced in the\\ninfected person.\\nSymptoms\\nSymptoms of Dengue fever\\n(i)\\nSudden onset of high fever, generally 104-105 °F (40 °C), which may last 4-\\n5 days.\\n(ii)\\nSevere headache mostly in the forehead.\\n(iii) pain in the joints and muscles, body aches.\\n(iv) Pain behind the eyes which worsens with eye movement.\\n(v)\\nNausea or vomiting.\\nSymptoms of Dengue hemorrhagic fever\\nThese include symptoms similar to dengue fever, plus other symptoms such as:\\n(i)\\nSevere and continuous pain in the abdomen.\\n(ii)\\nRashes on the skin.\\n(iii) Bleeding from the nose, mouth, or in the internal organs.\\n(iv) Frequent vomiting with or without blood.\\n(v)\\nBlack stools due to internal bleeding.\\n(vi) Excessive thirst (dry mouth).\\n(vii) Pale, cold skin, weakness.\\nPrevention\\nFollowing steps can be taken to prevent spread of dengue fever:\\n(i)\\nAvoid water stagnation for more than 72 hours so that the mosquitoes do not\\nbreed there.\\n(ii)\\nPrevent mosquito breeding in stored water bodies, like ponds, and wells.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\n 273\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\n(iii) Destroy discarded objects like old tyres and bottles, as they collect and store\\nrain water.\\n(iv) Use mosquito repellents and wear long sleeved clothes to curtail exposure.\\n(v)\\nUse mosquito nets, also during daytime.\\n(vi) Avoid outdoor activities during dawn or dusk when these mosquitoes are most\\nactive.\\n(vii) Patients suffering from dengue fever must be isolated for at least 5 days.\\n(viii) Report to the nearest health centre for any suspected case of Dengue fever.\\nTreatment for dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever\\nThere is no specific treatment for dengue fever.

Even a single dose of a powerful drug\\ncan start the addiction process. When one’s mind and body becomes\\naddicted to drugs, stopping drugs produces very unpleasant and\\ndistressing mental and physical symptoms. This makes the addict\\npersist with the usage of the drug. Addicts cannot give up their habit\\nunless they get medical treatment and counselling.\\nYou should not boast about your strong will power and assume that\\nyou can experiment with drugs without becoming addicted.

In other words, disease may be defined as a disorder in the physical,\\nphysiological, psychological or social state of a person caused due to nutritional\\ndeficiency, physiological disorder, genetic disorder, pathogen or any other reason.\\n29.1.1 Types of Diseases\\nThe diseases may be classified into two broad categories (Table 29.1).\\nTable 29.1 Classification of human diseases\\nDiseases\\nCongenital diseases\\nAcquired diseases\\n(Present since birth)\\n(Develop after birth)\\nCommunicable diseases\\nNon-communicable diseases\\n(Spread from infected person\\n(do not spread from a diseased person\\nto healthy person\\nto a healthy person)\\nDegenerative\\nDeficiency\\nAllergies\\nCancer\\nOther diseases\\ndiseases\\ndiseases\\n(caused due to\\n(caused due to\\n(caused due to\\n(caused due to\\n(caused due to\\nhypersensitivity uncontrolled\\nvarious physical\\nmalfunctioning\\nlack of nutrients of the body to\\ngrowth of cells/\\nagents or any\\nof vital body\\nin diet)\\ncertain foreign\\ntissues)\\nother reason)\\norgan)\\nsubstances)\\nA. Congenital disease : The disease which is present from birth (e.g. hole in the\\nheart in infants). They are caused by some genetic abnormality or metabolic\\ndisorder or malfunctioning of an organ.\\nB. Acquired disease : The disease which may occur after birth during one’s\\nlifetime.\\nAcquired diseases may generally be classified into :\\n(i)\\nInfectious diseases : The diseases which can be transmitted from diseased\\nhealthy person person to e.g. measles.\\n(ii) Degenerative diseases : The diseases caused by the malfunction of some vital\\norgans of the body e.g. heart failure.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 266\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\n(iii) Deficiency diseases : These are caused due to nutritional deficiency such as\\nthat of minerals or vitamins in the diet e.g. anaemia (Fe), Beri- beri (vitamin\\nB). You have read about such diseases in an earlier lesson 27.\\n(iv) Cancer : This is an abnormal, uncontrolled and unwanted growth of cells. e.g.\\nbreast cancer.\\nAcquired diseases are studied under two categories (Table 29.2).\\n(i)\\nCommunicable diseases : The diseases which can be transmitted from\\nan infected person to a healthy person.\\n(ii)\\nNon-communicable diseases : These diseases do not spread from an\\naffected person to a healthy person.\\nTable 29.2 Differences between communicable and\\nnon-communicable diseases\\nCommunicable diseases\\nNon-communicable diseases\\n1.

The concern of the diseases involves\\nthe society as these are related to\\ncommunity health.\\n29.1.2 Modes of Spread of Communicable  Diseases\\nCommunicable diseases spread from the infected person to a healthy person in the\\nfollowing ways.\\nDirect transmission\\nThe pathogens of diseases infect a healthy person directly without an intermediate\\nagent. It can take place by various means such as,\\n(i)\\nDirect contact between the infected person and the healthy person :\\nDiseases like small pox, chicken pox, syphilis, gonorrhoea spread through direct\\ncontact.\\n(ii) Droplet infection : The infected person throws out tiny droplets of mucus by\\ncoughing, sneezing or spitting. These droplets may contain the pathogen. By\\ninhaling the air containing the droplets, a healthy person may get the infection.\\nDiseases like common cold, pneumonia, influenza, measles, tuberculosis and\\nwhooping cough spread through droplet infection.\\nCaused due to some specific factor,\\nsuch as malfunctioning of some vital\\norgan, and deficiency of nutrients.\\nDo not spread from one person to\\nanother by contact.\\nThe concern of the disease is restricted\\nto the individual only.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\n 267\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\n(iii) Contact with soil contaminated with disease-causing viruses and bacteria.\\n(iv) Animal bite : Viruses of rabies are introduced through the wound caused by\\nthe bite of rabid animals, especially dogs. The virus is present in the saliva of\\nthe rabid animals.\\nIndirect transmission\\nThe pathogens of certain diseases reach the human body through some intermediate\\nagents. It can take place by various means, which are as follows :\\n(i)\\nBy vectors such as houseflies, mosquitoes, and cockroaches. Examples:\\nHouseflies carry the causative organisms of cholera on their legs and mouth\\nparts from the faeces and sputum of infected persons to food and drinks and\\ncontaminate them. When this contaminated food is taken by a healthy person,\\nhe gets the infection. Similarly, mosquitoes carry virus of dengue and malarial\\nparasite which causes malaria.\\n(ii) Air-borne : The pathogens may reach humans with air and dust. The epidemic\\ntyphus spreads by inhalation of dried faeces of infected fly.\\n(iii) Object borne (Fonite borne) : Many diseases are transmitted through the use\\nof contaminated articles, such as clothes, utensils, toys, door handles, taps,\\nsyringes and surgical instruments.\\n(iv) Water borne : If potable water (drinking water) is contaminated with\\npathogens of diseases such as cholera, diarhhoea, hepatitis or jaundice, it\\nreaches a healthy person upon consuming such water.\\n29.2 SOME IMPORTANT TERMS TO REMEMBER\\nPathogen : A living organism which causes a disease.\\nParasite : An organism which gets food and shelter from host.\\nHost : The living body on or inside which the disease-producing organism takes\\nshelter.\\nInfestation : Presence of a large number of parasitic organisms on the surface of\\nbody of the host or on the clothings.\\nVector : It is an organism which harbours a pathogen and may pass it on to another\\nperson to cause a disease (Mosquitoes harbour malarial parasite and transmits it\\nto humans).\\nCarrier : It is an organism which itself does not harbour the pathogen but physically\\ntransmits it to another person (Housefly is the carrier of cholera germs).\\nReservoir : An organism which harbours pathogens in large numbers that do not\\ncause any suffering to it.\\nEpidemic : Spreading of a disease among a large number of people causing a huge\\nloss of life in the same place for some time e.g. plague.\\nEndemic : A disease which is regularly found among a particular group of people\\ne.g. goitre, restricted to a certain locality or a country.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 268\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nPandemic : A disease which is found all over the world e.g. AIDS.\\nInterferon : Type of proteins produced by infected cells of the body when attacked\\nby a virus, which act to prevent the further development of the same virus.\\nInoculation : Introduction of antigenic material inside the body to prevent suffering\\nfrom a disease.\\nVaccination : Injection of a weak strain of a specific bacterium (Vaccine) in order\\nto secure immunity against the corresponding disease.

Influenza\\nInfluenza, commonly known as ‘flu’ is an illness caused by viruses that infect the\\nrespiratory tract. Compared to common cold, influenza is a more severe illness.\\nCauses\\nInfluenza is caused by a virus which attacks our body’s cells, resulting in various\\neffects depending on the strain of the virus.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\n 271\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nThere are many strains of influenza virus. The virus mutates all the time and new\\nvariations (strains) arise. This constant changing enables the virus to evade the\\nimmune system of its host. Unfortunately immunity against one strain (which is\\nconferred by exposure or immunisation) does not protect against other strains. A\\nperson infected with influenza virus develops antibodies against that virus; as the\\nvirus changes, the antibodies against the virus do not recognize the changed virus,\\nand influenza can recur, caused by the changed or mutated virus.\\nSymptoms\\nTypical symptoms of influenza include:\\n(i)\\nfever (Usually 100° F to 103° F in adults and often even higher in children).\\n(ii) respiratory tract infection symptoms such as, cough, sore throat, running\\nnose, headache, pain in the muscles, and extreme fatigue.\\nAlthough nausea and vomiting and diarrhoea can sometimes accompany Influenza\\ninfection, especially in children, gastrointestinal symptoms are rarely prominent.\\nMost people who get flu, recover completely in 1 to 2 weeks, but some people\\ndevelop serious and potentially life-threatening complications, such as pneumonia.\\nTreatment and Control\\n(i) Much of the illness and death caused by influenza can be prevented by annual\\ninfluenza vaccination. Influenza vaccine is specifically recommended for those\\nwho are at high risk for complications with chronic diseases of the heart, lungs\\nor kidneys, diabetes, or severe forms of anaemia.\\n(ii) The persons suffering from influenza should\\nz\\ndrink plenty of fluids\\nz\\ntake symptom relief with paracetamol, aspirin (not in children under the\\nage of 16) or ibuprofen as recommended by the doctor.\\nz\\nConsult doctor immediately for treatment.\\n7. Dengue\\nDengue is an acute fever caused by virus. It is of two types: (i) Dengue fever, (ii)\\nDengue hemorrhagic fever.\\nDengue fever is characterized by an onset of sudden high fever, severe headache,\\npain behind the eyes and in the muscles and joints.\\nDengue hemorrhagic fever is an acute infectious viral disease. It is an advanced\\nstage of dengue fever. It is characterized by fever during the initial phase and other\\nsymptoms like headache, pain in the eye, joint pain and muscle pain, followed by\\nsigns of bleeding, red tiny spots on the skin, and bleeding from nose and gums.\\nHow does Dengue spread?\\nDengue spreads through the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito. The\\ntransmission of the disease occurs when a mosquito bites an infected person and\\nsubsequently bites a healthy person. In doing so, it transmits blood containing the'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 272\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nvirus to the healthy person and the person becomes infected with dengue. The first\\nsymptoms of the disease occur about 5 to 7 days after the infected bite.\\nAedes mosquito rests indoors, in closets and other dark places, and is active during\\nday time. Outside, it rests where it is cool and shaded. The female mosquito lays\\nher eggs in stagnant water containers such as coolers, tyres, empty buckets, in and\\naround homes, and other areas in towns or villages. These eggs become adults in\\nabout 10 days.\\nIncubation period\\nThe time between the bite of a mosquito carrying dengue virus and the start of\\nsymptoms averages 4 to 6 days, with a range of 3 to 14 days.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is made through blood tests by scanning for antibodies against dengue\\nviruses. In addition the blood platelet counts also get drastically reduced in the\\ninfected person.\\nSymptoms\\nSymptoms of Dengue fever\\n(i)\\nSudden onset of high fever, generally 104-105 °F (40 °C), which may last 4-\\n5 days.\\n(ii)\\nSevere headache mostly in the forehead.\\n(iii) pain in the joints and muscles, body aches.\\n(iv) Pain behind the eyes which worsens with eye movement.\\n(v)\\nNausea or vomiting.\\nSymptoms of Dengue hemorrhagic fever\\nThese include symptoms similar to dengue fever, plus other symptoms such as:\\n(i)\\nSevere and continuous pain in the abdomen.\\n(ii)\\nRashes on the skin.\\n(iii) Bleeding from the nose, mouth, or in the internal organs.\\n(iv) Frequent vomiting with or without blood.\\n(v)\\nBlack stools due to internal bleeding.\\n(vi) Excessive thirst (dry mouth).\\n(vii) Pale, cold skin, weakness.\\nPrevention\\nFollowing steps can be taken to prevent spread of dengue fever:\\n(i)\\nAvoid water stagnation for more than 72 hours so that the mosquitoes do not\\nbreed there.\\n(ii)\\nPrevent mosquito breeding in stored water bodies, like ponds, and wells.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\n 273\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\n(iii) Destroy discarded objects like old tyres and bottles, as they collect and store\\nrain water.\\n(iv) Use mosquito repellents and wear long sleeved clothes to curtail exposure.\\n(v)\\nUse mosquito nets, also during daytime.\\n(vi) Avoid outdoor activities during dawn or dusk when these mosquitoes are most\\nactive.\\n(vii) Patients suffering from dengue fever must be isolated for at least 5 days.\\n(viii) Report to the nearest health centre for any suspected case of Dengue fever.\\nTreatment for dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever\\nThere is no specific treatment for dengue fever.

They will do anything for the dose,\\nincluding committing crimes such as theft and in certain case even murder.\\nSome Basic Facts\\nTeenagers sometimes try a smoke or drink just to see how it\\nfeels, but they do not start using drugs on a regular basis. What\\nis the harm in trying drugs just to see how it feels?\\nIdeally, there is no need to try out a smoke or drink.\\nBut there is a great difference between “ trying out” smoking  or\\ndrinking as compared to drugs.\\nSmoking and drinking once only or very occasionally does not\\nalways lead to addiction. But drugs are very powerful chemicals that\\ncan cause profound alterations in the metabolism of the  body and\\nin the chemistry of the brain. Even a single dose of a powerful drug\\ncan start the addiction process. When one’s mind and body becomes\\naddicted to drugs, stopping drugs produces very unpleasant and\\ndistressing mental and physical symptoms. This makes the addict\\npersist with the usage of the drug. Addicts cannot give up their habit\\nunless they get medical treatment and counselling.\\nYou should not boast about your strong will power and assume that\\nyou can experiment with drugs without becoming addicted.

It can affect almost any part of the body and is known for its ability to invade and destroy surrounding tissue.\\n\\n2. **Cell Division and Cancer**: Normally, cells in the body grow, divide, and die in a controlled manner. In the case of cancer, this process is disrupted. Cells become abnormal and start dividing uncontrollably, forming tumors. These tumors can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous).\\n\\n3. **How Cancer Spreads**: Cancerous cells can invade nearby tissues and organs, and in some cases, break away from the tumor and travel to other parts of the body through the bloodstream or lymphatic system, leading to the formation of new tumors. This process is called metastasis.\\n\\n4. **Causes and Risk Factors**: Cancer can be caused by a variety of factors including genetic mutations, exposure to carcinogens (such as those found in tobacco smoke or certain chemicals), radiation, viruses, and certain genetic predispositions. Lifestyle factors, such as diet, physical activity level, and alcohol consumption, can also influence cancer risk.\\n\\n5. **Types of Cancer**: There are over 100 different types of cancer, each with its own set of characteristics and treatment options. The most common types include breast cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, and skin cancer.\\n\\n6. **Symptoms and Diagnosis**: Symptoms of cancer vary depending on the type and location of the tumor. Common symptoms include unexplained weight loss, fatigue, pain, and changes in bowel or bladder habits. Diagnosis typically involves a combination of physical examination, imaging tests (such as X-rays, CT scans, or MRI scans), and biopsies.\\n\\n7. **Treatment Options**: Treatment for cancer depends on the type and stage of the disease, as well as the patient\\'s overall health. Common treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy.\\n\\nGiven the absence of specific human feedback, the response is tailored to provide a broad overview of cancer, including its definition, how it works, causes, types, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment options.\\n\\n**Final Answer**: Cancer is a complex and multifaceted group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells.

The concern of the diseases involves\\nthe society as these are related to\\ncommunity health.\\n29.1.2 Modes of Spread of Communicable  Diseases\\nCommunicable diseases spread from the infected person to a healthy person in the\\nfollowing ways.\\nDirect transmission\\nThe pathogens of diseases infect a healthy person directly without an intermediate\\nagent. It can take place by various means such as,\\n(i)\\nDirect contact between the infected person and the healthy person :\\nDiseases like small pox, chicken pox, syphilis, gonorrhoea spread through direct\\ncontact.\\n(ii) Droplet infection : The infected person throws out tiny droplets of mucus by\\ncoughing, sneezing or spitting. These droplets may contain the pathogen. By\\ninhaling the air containing the droplets, a healthy person may get the infection.\\nDiseases like common cold, pneumonia, influenza, measles, tuberculosis and\\nwhooping cough spread through droplet infection.\\nCaused due to some specific factor,\\nsuch as malfunctioning of some vital\\norgan, and deficiency of nutrients.\\nDo not spread from one person to\\nanother by contact.\\nThe concern of the disease is restricted\\nto the individual only.', 'Some Common Human Diseases\\n 267\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\n(iii) Contact with soil contaminated with disease-causing viruses and bacteria.\\n(iv) Animal bite : Viruses of rabies are introduced through the wound caused by\\nthe bite of rabid animals, especially dogs. The virus is present in the saliva of\\nthe rabid animals.\\nIndirect transmission\\nThe pathogens of certain diseases reach the human body through some intermediate\\nagents. It can take place by various means, which are as follows :\\n(i)\\nBy vectors such as houseflies, mosquitoes, and cockroaches. Examples:\\nHouseflies carry the causative organisms of cholera on their legs and mouth\\nparts from the faeces and sputum of infected persons to food and drinks and\\ncontaminate them. When this contaminated food is taken by a healthy person,\\nhe gets the infection. Similarly, mosquitoes carry virus of dengue and malarial\\nparasite which causes malaria.\\n(ii) Air-borne : The pathogens may reach humans with air and dust. The epidemic\\ntyphus spreads by inhalation of dried faeces of infected fly.\\n(iii) Object borne (Fonite borne) : Many diseases are transmitted through the use\\nof contaminated articles, such as clothes, utensils, toys, door handles, taps,\\nsyringes and surgical instruments.\\n(iv) Water borne : If potable water (drinking water) is contaminated with\\npathogens of diseases such as cholera, diarhhoea, hepatitis or jaundice, it\\nreaches a healthy person upon consuming such water.\\n29.2 SOME IMPORTANT TERMS TO REMEMBER\\nPathogen : A living organism which causes a disease.\\nParasite : An organism which gets food and shelter from host.\\nHost : The living body on or inside which the disease-producing organism takes\\nshelter.\\nInfestation : Presence of a large number of parasitic organisms on the surface of\\nbody of the host or on the clothings.\\nVector : It is an organism which harbours a pathogen and may pass it on to another\\nperson to cause a disease (Mosquitoes harbour malarial parasite and transmits it\\nto humans).\\nCarrier : It is an organism which itself does not harbour the pathogen but physically\\ntransmits it to another person (Housefly is the carrier of cholera germs).\\nReservoir : An organism which harbours pathogens in large numbers that do not\\ncause any suffering to it.\\nEpidemic : Spreading of a disease among a large number of people causing a huge\\nloss of life in the same place for some time e.g. plague.\\nEndemic : A disease which is regularly found among a particular group of people\\ne.g. goitre, restricted to a certain locality or a country.', 'Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 268\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nPandemic : A disease which is found all over the world e.g. AIDS.\\nInterferon : Type of proteins produced by infected cells of the body when attacked\\nby a virus, which act to prevent the further development of the same virus.\\nInoculation : Introduction of antigenic material inside the body to prevent suffering\\nfrom a disease.\\nVaccination : Injection of a weak strain of a specific bacterium (Vaccine) in order\\nto secure immunity against the corresponding disease.

Influenza\\nInfluenza, commonly known as ‘flu’ is an illness caused by viruses that infect the\\nrespiratory tract. Compared to common cold, influenza is a more severe illness.\\nCauses\\nInfluenza is caused by a virus which attacks our body’s cells, resulting in various\\neffects depending on the strain of the virus.', 'Some Common Human Diseases\\n 271\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nThere are many strains of influenza virus. The virus mutates all the time and new\\nvariations (strains) arise. This constant changing enables the virus to evade the\\nimmune system of its host. Unfortunately immunity against one strain (which is\\nconferred by exposure or immunisation) does not protect against other strains. A\\nperson infected with influenza virus develops antibodies against that virus; as the\\nvirus changes, the antibodies against the virus do not recognize the changed virus,\\nand influenza can recur, caused by the changed or mutated virus.\\nSymptoms\\nTypical symptoms of influenza include:\\n(i)\\nfever (Usually 100° F to 103° F in adults and often even higher in children).\\n(ii) respiratory tract infection symptoms such as, cough, sore throat, running\\nnose, headache, pain in the muscles, and extreme fatigue.\\nAlthough nausea and vomiting and diarrhoea can sometimes accompany Influenza\\ninfection, especially in children, gastrointestinal symptoms are rarely prominent.\\nMost people who get flu, recover completely in 1 to 2 weeks, but some people\\ndevelop serious and potentially life-threatening complications, such as pneumonia.\\nTreatment and Control\\n(i) Much of the illness and death caused by influenza can be prevented by annual\\ninfluenza vaccination. Influenza vaccine is specifically recommended for those\\nwho are at high risk for complications with chronic diseases of the heart, lungs\\nor kidneys, diabetes, or severe forms of anaemia.\\n(ii) The persons suffering from influenza should\\nz\\ndrink plenty of fluids\\nz\\ntake symptom relief with paracetamol, aspirin (not in children under the\\nage of 16) or ibuprofen as recommended by the doctor.\\nz\\nConsult doctor immediately for treatment.\\n7. Dengue\\nDengue is an acute fever caused by virus. It is of two types: (i) Dengue fever, (ii)\\nDengue hemorrhagic fever.\\nDengue fever is characterized by an onset of sudden high fever, severe headache,\\npain behind the eyes and in the muscles and joints.\\nDengue hemorrhagic fever is an acute infectious viral disease. It is an advanced\\nstage of dengue fever. It is characterized by fever during the initial phase and other\\nsymptoms like headache, pain in the eye, joint pain and muscle pain, followed by\\nsigns of bleeding, red tiny spots on the skin, and bleeding from nose and gums.\\nHow does Dengue spread?\\nDengue spreads through the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito. The\\ntransmission of the disease occurs when a mosquito bites an infected person and\\nsubsequently bites a healthy person. In doing so, it transmits blood containing the', 'Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 272\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nvirus to the healthy person and the person becomes infected with dengue. The first\\nsymptoms of the disease occur about 5 to 7 days after the infected bite.\\nAedes mosquito rests indoors, in closets and other dark places, and is active during\\nday time. Outside, it rests where it is cool and shaded. The female mosquito lays\\nher eggs in stagnant water containers such as coolers, tyres, empty buckets, in and\\naround homes, and other areas in towns or villages. These eggs become adults in\\nabout 10 days.\\nIncubation period\\nThe time between the bite of a mosquito carrying dengue virus and the start of\\nsymptoms averages 4 to 6 days, with a range of 3 to 14 days.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is made through blood tests by scanning for antibodies against dengue\\nviruses. In addition the blood platelet counts also get drastically reduced in the\\ninfected person.\\nSymptoms\\nSymptoms of Dengue fever\\n(i)\\nSudden onset of high fever, generally 104-105 °F (40 °C), which may last 4-\\n5 days.\\n(ii)\\nSevere headache mostly in the forehead.\\n(iii) pain in the joints and muscles, body aches.\\n(iv) Pain behind the eyes which worsens with eye movement.\\n(v)\\nNausea or vomiting.\\nSymptoms of Dengue hemorrhagic fever\\nThese include symptoms similar to dengue fever, plus other symptoms such as:\\n(i)\\nSevere and continuous pain in the abdomen.\\n(ii)\\nRashes on the skin.\\n(iii) Bleeding from the nose, mouth, or in the internal organs.\\n(iv) Frequent vomiting with or without blood.\\n(v)\\nBlack stools due to internal bleeding.\\n(vi) Excessive thirst (dry mouth).\\n(vii) Pale, cold skin, weakness.\\nPrevention\\nFollowing steps can be taken to prevent spread of dengue fever:\\n(i)\\nAvoid water stagnation for more than 72 hours so that the mosquitoes do not\\nbreed there.\\n(ii)\\nPrevent mosquito breeding in stored water bodies, like ponds, and wells.', 'Some Common Human Diseases\\n 273\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\n(iii) Destroy discarded objects like old tyres and bottles, as they collect and store\\nrain water.\\n(iv) Use mosquito repellents and wear long sleeved clothes to curtail exposure.\\n(v)\\nUse mosquito nets, also during daytime.\\n(vi) Avoid outdoor activities during dawn or dusk when these mosquitoes are most\\nactive.\\n(vii) Patients suffering from dengue fever must be isolated for at least 5 days.\\n(viii) Report to the nearest health centre for any suspected case of Dengue fever.\\nTreatment for dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever\\nThere is no specific treatment for dengue fever. Persons with dengue fever should\\nrest and drink plenty of fluids. Dengue hemorrhagic fever is treated by replacing\\nlost fluids.

A\\npharmaceutical preparation or a naturally occurring substance used primarily to alter\\nthe physical or mental functioning of an individual, is called a drug.\\nWhat is drug abuse\\nWhen drugs are taken for medical reasons to treat or cure disease both physical\\nand mental, they are called medications or therapeutic drugs.\\nDrug abuse occurs when drugs are taken without medical reasons and without\\nmedical supervision, especially when they are taken in an amount, strength,\\nfrequency, or manner that damages the physical and mental functioning of the\\nindividual. Cough syrups, pain killers, and tranquillizers are some common medicines\\nthat are often abused.', 'Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 286\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nDrug abuse also occurs when certain chemicals that have no medical use or benefits\\nare taken, such as sniffing glue and solvents. The extent of drug abuse depends on\\nthe quantity of the drug being taken, and the method and frequency of its\\nconsumption. Drug abuse leads to many serious physical, emotional, and social\\nproblems.\\nWhat are the effects of drug abuse?\\nDrug abuse leads to a number of short-term and long-term effects that are\\ndetrimental to health:\\nz\\nShort-term effects : These are the effects that appear instantly or a few minutes\\nafter the intake of drugs. The effects include a sense of well-being and a pleasant\\ndrowsiness.\\nz\\nLong-term effects :  Constant and excessive use of drugs over a long period\\ncan cause both physical and mental damage and illness. This includes failure in\\nacademic studies, employment, and interpersonal relationship; financial ruin;\\nincreased risk of contracting STIs; and increased risk of being involved in\\nvehicular accidents. Addicts stop thinking of everything in life except when and\\nhow they will get their next drug dose. They will do anything for the dose,\\nincluding committing crimes such as theft and in certain case even murder.\\nSome Basic Facts\\nTeenagers sometimes try a smoke or drink just to see how it\\nfeels, but they do not start using drugs on a regular basis. What\\nis the harm in trying drugs just to see how it feels?\\nIdeally, there is no need to try out a smoke or drink.\\nBut there is a great difference between “ trying out” smoking  or\\ndrinking as compared to drugs.\\nSmoking and drinking once only or very occasionally does not\\nalways lead to addiction. But drugs are very powerful chemicals that\\ncan cause profound alterations in the metabolism of the  body and\\nin the chemistry of the brain. Even a single dose of a powerful drug\\ncan start the addiction process. When one’s mind and body becomes\\naddicted to drugs, stopping drugs produces very unpleasant and\\ndistressing mental and physical symptoms. This makes the addict\\npersist with the usage of the drug. Addicts cannot give up their habit\\nunless they get medical treatment and counselling.\\nYou should not boast about your strong will power and assume that\\nyou can experiment with drugs without becoming addicted. ALWAYS\\nKEEP AWAY from drugs. Do not allow yourself to succumb to\\npressure by friends and acquaintances. If you remain firm in your\\nresolve, you can prevent your life from being ruined.', 'Some Common Human Diseases\\n 287\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nSome Basic Facts\\nWhat are Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs)?\\nRTIs are infections of the upper and lower reproductive tracts of\\nboth sexes. Agents of infection include bacteria, viruses, and\\nprotozoa. Not all RTIs are sexually transmitted; some may occur\\ndue to an imbalance of the bacteria normally found in the reproductive\\ntract and poor personal hygiene.\\nSome Basic Facts\\nIs it possible for a person to have an RTI (Reproductive  Tract\\nInfection) without knowing about it?\\nSymptoms of RTIs in men are visible, and hence they become aware\\nthat their sexual organs have been infected.\\nHowever, RTIs in women sometimes can be asymptomatic. This\\nmeans that signs or symptoms are not experienced even though the\\ninfection is active. Hence women often do not know that they have\\nRTI.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 29.7\\n1.

In other words, disease may be defined as a disorder in the physical,\\nphysiological, psychological or social state of a person caused due to nutritional\\ndeficiency, physiological disorder, genetic disorder, pathogen or any other reason.\\n29.1.1 Types of Diseases\\nThe diseases may be classified into two broad categories (Table 29.1).\\nTable 29.1 Classification of human diseases\\nDiseases\\nCongenital diseases\\nAcquired diseases\\n(Present since birth)\\n(Develop after birth)\\nCommunicable diseases\\nNon-communicable diseases\\n(Spread from infected person\\n(do not spread from a diseased person\\nto healthy person\\nto a healthy person)\\nDegenerative\\nDeficiency\\nAllergies\\nCancer\\nOther diseases\\ndiseases\\ndiseases\\n(caused due to\\n(caused due to\\n(caused due to\\n(caused due to\\n(caused due to\\nhypersensitivity uncontrolled\\nvarious physical\\nmalfunctioning\\nlack of nutrients of the body to\\ngrowth of cells/\\nagents or any\\nof vital body\\nin diet)\\ncertain foreign\\ntissues)\\nother reason)\\norgan)\\nsubstances)\\nA. Congenital disease : The disease which is present from birth (e.g. hole in the\\nheart in infants). They are caused by some genetic abnormality or metabolic\\ndisorder or malfunctioning of an organ.\\nB. Acquired disease : The disease which may occur after birth during one’s\\nlifetime.\\nAcquired diseases may generally be classified into :\\n(i)\\nInfectious diseases : The diseases which can be transmitted from diseased\\nhealthy person person to e.g. measles.\\n(ii) Degenerative diseases : The diseases caused by the malfunction of some vital\\norgans of the body e.g. heart failure.', 'Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 266\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\n(iii) Deficiency diseases : These are caused due to nutritional deficiency such as\\nthat of minerals or vitamins in the diet e.g. anaemia (Fe), Beri- beri (vitamin\\nB). You have read about such diseases in an earlier lesson 27.\\n(iv) Cancer : This is an abnormal, uncontrolled and unwanted growth of cells. e.g.\\nbreast cancer.\\nAcquired diseases are studied under two categories (Table 29.2).\\n(i)\\nCommunicable diseases : The diseases which can be transmitted from\\nan infected person to a healthy person.\\n(ii)\\nNon-communicable diseases : These diseases do not spread from an\\naffected person to a healthy person.\\nTable 29.2 Differences between communicable and\\nnon-communicable diseases\\nCommunicable diseases\\nNon-communicable diseases\\n1.

The concern of the diseases involves\\nthe society as these are related to\\ncommunity health.\\n29.1.2 Modes of Spread of Communicable  Diseases\\nCommunicable diseases spread from the infected person to a healthy person in the\\nfollowing ways.\\nDirect transmission\\nThe pathogens of diseases infect a healthy person directly without an intermediate\\nagent. It can take place by various means such as,\\n(i)\\nDirect contact between the infected person and the healthy person :\\nDiseases like small pox, chicken pox, syphilis, gonorrhoea spread through direct\\ncontact.\\n(ii) Droplet infection : The infected person throws out tiny droplets of mucus by\\ncoughing, sneezing or spitting. These droplets may contain the pathogen. By\\ninhaling the air containing the droplets, a healthy person may get the infection.\\nDiseases like common cold, pneumonia, influenza, measles, tuberculosis and\\nwhooping cough spread through droplet infection.\\nCaused due to some specific factor,\\nsuch as malfunctioning of some vital\\norgan, and deficiency of nutrients.\\nDo not spread from one person to\\nanother by contact.\\nThe concern of the disease is restricted\\nto the individual only.', 'Some Common Human Diseases\\n 267\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\n(iii) Contact with soil contaminated with disease-causing viruses and bacteria.\\n(iv) Animal bite : Viruses of rabies are introduced through the wound caused by\\nthe bite of rabid animals, especially dogs. The virus is present in the saliva of\\nthe rabid animals.\\nIndirect transmission\\nThe pathogens of certain diseases reach the human body through some intermediate\\nagents. It can take place by various means, which are as follows :\\n(i)\\nBy vectors such as houseflies, mosquitoes, and cockroaches. Examples:\\nHouseflies carry the causative organisms of cholera on their legs and mouth\\nparts from the faeces and sputum of infected persons to food and drinks and\\ncontaminate them. When this contaminated food is taken by a healthy person,\\nhe gets the infection. Similarly, mosquitoes carry virus of dengue and malarial\\nparasite which causes malaria.\\n(ii) Air-borne : The pathogens may reach humans with air and dust. The epidemic\\ntyphus spreads by inhalation of dried faeces of infected fly.\\n(iii) Object borne (Fonite borne) : Many diseases are transmitted through the use\\nof contaminated articles, such as clothes, utensils, toys, door handles, taps,\\nsyringes and surgical instruments.\\n(iv) Water borne : If potable water (drinking water) is contaminated with\\npathogens of diseases such as cholera, diarhhoea, hepatitis or jaundice, it\\nreaches a healthy person upon consuming such water.\\n29.2 SOME IMPORTANT TERMS TO REMEMBER\\nPathogen : A living organism which causes a disease.\\nParasite : An organism which gets food and shelter from host.\\nHost : The living body on or inside which the disease-producing organism takes\\nshelter.\\nInfestation : Presence of a large number of parasitic organisms on the surface of\\nbody of the host or on the clothings.\\nVector : It is an organism which harbours a pathogen and may pass it on to another\\nperson to cause a disease (Mosquitoes harbour malarial parasite and transmits it\\nto humans).\\nCarrier : It is an organism which itself does not harbour the pathogen but physically\\ntransmits it to another person (Housefly is the carrier of cholera germs).\\nReservoir : An organism which harbours pathogens in large numbers that do not\\ncause any suffering to it.\\nEpidemic : Spreading of a disease among a large number of people causing a huge\\nloss of life in the same place for some time e.g. plague.\\nEndemic : A disease which is regularly found among a particular group of people\\ne.g. goitre, restricted to a certain locality or a country.', 'Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 268\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nPandemic : A disease which is found all over the world e.g. AIDS.\\nInterferon : Type of proteins produced by infected cells of the body when attacked\\nby a virus, which act to prevent the further development of the same virus.\\nInoculation : Introduction of antigenic material inside the body to prevent suffering\\nfrom a disease.\\nVaccination : Injection of a weak strain of a specific bacterium (Vaccine) in order\\nto secure immunity against the corresponding disease. It is also called immunisation.\\nIncubation period : The period between entry of pathogen inside a healthy body\\nand appearance of the symptoms of the disease.\\nSymptoms : Specific morphological or physiological expressions which appear on\\nthe deseased organism and help in the identification of the disease.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 29.1\\n1.

Influenza\\nInfluenza, commonly known as ‘flu’ is an illness caused by viruses that infect the\\nrespiratory tract. Compared to common cold, influenza is a more severe illness.\\nCauses\\nInfluenza is caused by a virus which attacks our body’s cells, resulting in various\\neffects depending on the strain of the virus.', 'Some Common Human Diseases\\n 271\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nThere are many strains of influenza virus. The virus mutates all the time and new\\nvariations (strains) arise. This constant changing enables the virus to evade the\\nimmune system of its host. Unfortunately immunity against one strain (which is\\nconferred by exposure or immunisation) does not protect against other strains. A\\nperson infected with influenza virus develops antibodies against that virus; as the\\nvirus changes, the antibodies against the virus do not recognize the changed virus,\\nand influenza can recur, caused by the changed or mutated virus.\\nSymptoms\\nTypical symptoms of influenza include:\\n(i)\\nfever (Usually 100° F to 103° F in adults and often even higher in children).\\n(ii) respiratory tract infection symptoms such as, cough, sore throat, running\\nnose, headache, pain in the muscles, and extreme fatigue.\\nAlthough nausea and vomiting and diarrhoea can sometimes accompany Influenza\\ninfection, especially in children, gastrointestinal symptoms are rarely prominent.\\nMost people who get flu, recover completely in 1 to 2 weeks, but some people\\ndevelop serious and potentially life-threatening complications, such as pneumonia.\\nTreatment and Control\\n(i) Much of the illness and death caused by influenza can be prevented by annual\\ninfluenza vaccination. Influenza vaccine is specifically recommended for those\\nwho are at high risk for complications with chronic diseases of the heart, lungs\\nor kidneys, diabetes, or severe forms of anaemia.\\n(ii) The persons suffering from influenza should\\nz\\ndrink plenty of fluids\\nz\\ntake symptom relief with paracetamol, aspirin (not in children under the\\nage of 16) or ibuprofen as recommended by the doctor.\\nz\\nConsult doctor immediately for treatment.\\n7. Dengue\\nDengue is an acute fever caused by virus. It is of two types: (i) Dengue fever, (ii)\\nDengue hemorrhagic fever.\\nDengue fever is characterized by an onset of sudden high fever, severe headache,\\npain behind the eyes and in the muscles and joints.\\nDengue hemorrhagic fever is an acute infectious viral disease. It is an advanced\\nstage of dengue fever. It is characterized by fever during the initial phase and other\\nsymptoms like headache, pain in the eye, joint pain and muscle pain, followed by\\nsigns of bleeding, red tiny spots on the skin, and bleeding from nose and gums.\\nHow does Dengue spread?\\nDengue spreads through the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito. The\\ntransmission of the disease occurs when a mosquito bites an infected person and\\nsubsequently bites a healthy person. In doing so, it transmits blood containing the', 'Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 272\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nvirus to the healthy person and the person becomes infected with dengue. The first\\nsymptoms of the disease occur about 5 to 7 days after the infected bite.\\nAedes mosquito rests indoors, in closets and other dark places, and is active during\\nday time. Outside, it rests where it is cool and shaded. The female mosquito lays\\nher eggs in stagnant water containers such as coolers, tyres, empty buckets, in and\\naround homes, and other areas in towns or villages. These eggs become adults in\\nabout 10 days.\\nIncubation period\\nThe time between the bite of a mosquito carrying dengue virus and the start of\\nsymptoms averages 4 to 6 days, with a range of 3 to 14 days.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is made through blood tests by scanning for antibodies against dengue\\nviruses. In addition the blood platelet counts also get drastically reduced in the\\ninfected person.\\nSymptoms\\nSymptoms of Dengue fever\\n(i)\\nSudden onset of high fever, generally 104-105 °F (40 °C), which may last 4-\\n5 days.\\n(ii)\\nSevere headache mostly in the forehead.\\n(iii) pain in the joints and muscles, body aches.\\n(iv) Pain behind the eyes which worsens with eye movement.\\n(v)\\nNausea or vomiting.\\nSymptoms of Dengue hemorrhagic fever\\nThese include symptoms similar to dengue fever, plus other symptoms such as:\\n(i)\\nSevere and continuous pain in the abdomen.\\n(ii)\\nRashes on the skin.\\n(iii) Bleeding from the nose, mouth, or in the internal organs.\\n(iv) Frequent vomiting with or without blood.\\n(v)\\nBlack stools due to internal bleeding.\\n(vi) Excessive thirst (dry mouth).\\n(vii) Pale, cold skin, weakness.\\nPrevention\\nFollowing steps can be taken to prevent spread of dengue fever:\\n(i)\\nAvoid water stagnation for more than 72 hours so that the mosquitoes do not\\nbreed there.\\n(ii)\\nPrevent mosquito breeding in stored water bodies, like ponds, and wells.', 'Some Common Human Diseases\\n 273\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\n(iii) Destroy discarded objects like old tyres and bottles, as they collect and store\\nrain water.\\n(iv) Use mosquito repellents and wear long sleeved clothes to curtail exposure.\\n(v)\\nUse mosquito nets, also during daytime.\\n(vi) Avoid outdoor activities during dawn or dusk when these mosquitoes are most\\nactive.\\n(vii) Patients suffering from dengue fever must be isolated for at least 5 days.\\n(viii) Report to the nearest health centre for any suspected case of Dengue fever.\\nTreatment for dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever\\nThere is no specific treatment for dengue fever. Persons with dengue fever should\\nrest and drink plenty of fluids. Dengue hemorrhagic fever is treated by replacing\\nlost fluids.

Repeated spine fractures can cause\\nchronic lower back pain, as well as curving of the spine, which gives the\\nindividual a hunched-back appearance.\\n(iv) Some patients with osteoporosis develop stress fractures of the feet while\\nwalking or stepping off. Hip fractures typically occur as a result of a fall. With\\nosteoporosis, hip fractures can occur upon even minor accidents. Hip fractures\\nmay take a very long time to heal because of poor bone quality.\\nTreatment\\n(i)\\nPatients suffering from osteoporosis are generally treated with vitamin D and\\ncalcium supplements. In addition they are advised bed rest so that the condition\\ndoes not worsen.\\n(ii)\\nChanges to lifestyle and diet are also recommended. The patients are advised\\nto take calcium either via dietary means or via supplements in the form of\\ntablets. Since body absorbs about 500 mg calcium at a given time, the calcium\\nintake should be spread throughout the day.\\n(iii) Exercise also helps to protect persons from the risk of getting osteoporosis.\\nHowever, it is important to do exercises for osteoporosis under the guidance\\nof a professional physiotherapist.\\n4.

The word “immuno deficiency” signifies that the immune\\nsystem becomes very weak. It is a disease of cell-mediated immune system of the\\nbody.\\nLymphocytes are the main cells of the immune system i.e. T-lymphocytes and\\nB-lymphocytes. ‘Helper T’ lymphocytes play a great role in regulating the immune\\nsystem. Damages to or destruction of ‘Helper’ lymphocytes leads to the development\\nof a cellular immune deficiency which makes the patient susceptible to wide variety\\nof infections.\\nFig. 29.2 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)\\nMode of transmission : AIDS may be transmitted through any of the following\\nmeans :\\n(i)\\nSexual contact with the affected person.

Therefore,\\ncare has to be taken through following measures:\\n(i)\\nThere should not be any sexual contact with the person who has HIV infection\\nor STI. Since STI causes some damage to the genital area and mucous layer,\\nand thus facilitates the entry of HIV into the body.\\n(ii) Use disposable syringe and needle.\\n(iii) The blood to be transfused to the needy person, should be free from HIV germ.\\n(iv) Prostitution and homosexuality should be avoided.\\n(v) Condom should always be used during intercourse.\\nControl\\nAIDS can be detected by ELISA test.\\nThere are three points which may be important to control STD.\\n(i)\\nPartner notification : Identification of potential infected contact, examination\\nand treatment.\\n(ii) Education of STD : This should be a part of general education.\\n(iii) Screening for STD : Serological screening of groups, such as, blood donors,\\nwomen before giving birth.\\nFacts about HIV transmission\\nz HIV is a weak virus and hard to get infected with. It cannot be transmitted\\nthrough air or water outside the human body.\\nz A person cannot get AIDS by hugging or sneezing of an infected person, insect\\nbites (including mosquito), sharing the same comb, plates, glass, handkerchiefs,\\nknives or cutlery.\\nz A person cannot get AIDS by using public toilets, swimming pools, showers\\nand telephones.\\nz HIV cannot be transmitted by being near to someone, touching someone or\\nworking with someone who is suffering from AIDS.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 29.6\\n1.

Most\\nvictims of this disease are teenagers and young adults. One of the advanced\\ncomplications of gonorrhoea is gonococcal septicemia (blood poisoning).\\n29.6 DRUG ABUSE AND ITS PREVENTION\\nWhat is a drug\\nA drug is a chemical substance that changes the way our body and mind work. A\\npharmaceutical preparation or a naturally occurring substance used primarily to alter\\nthe physical or mental functioning of an individual, is called a drug.\\nWhat is drug abuse\\nWhen drugs are taken for medical reasons to treat or cure disease both physical\\nand mental, they are called medications or therapeutic drugs.\\nDrug abuse occurs when drugs are taken without medical reasons and without\\nmedical supervision, especially when they are taken in an amount, strength,\\nfrequency, or manner that damages the physical and mental functioning of the\\nindividual. Cough syrups, pain killers, and tranquillizers are some common medicines\\nthat are often abused.', 'Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 286\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nDrug abuse also occurs when certain chemicals that have no medical use or benefits\\nare taken, such as sniffing glue and solvents. The extent of drug abuse depends on\\nthe quantity of the drug being taken, and the method and frequency of its\\nconsumption. Drug abuse leads to many serious physical, emotional, and social\\nproblems.\\nWhat are the effects of drug abuse?\\nDrug abuse leads to a number of short-term and long-term effects that are\\ndetrimental to health:\\nz\\nShort-term effects : These are the effects that appear instantly or a few minutes\\nafter the intake of drugs. The effects include a sense of well-being and a pleasant\\ndrowsiness.\\nz\\nLong-term effects :  Constant and excessive use of drugs over a long period\\ncan cause both physical and mental damage and illness. This includes failure in\\nacademic studies, employment, and interpersonal relationship; financial ruin;\\nincreased risk of contracting STIs; and increased risk of being involved in\\nvehicular accidents. Addicts stop thinking of everything in life except when and\\nhow they will get their next drug dose. They will do anything for the dose,\\nincluding committing crimes such as theft and in certain case even murder.\\nSome Basic Facts\\nTeenagers sometimes try a smoke or drink just to see how it\\nfeels, but they do not start using drugs on a regular basis. What\\nis the harm in trying drugs just to see how it feels?\\nIdeally, there is no need to try out a smoke or drink.\\nBut there is a great difference between “ trying out” smoking  or\\ndrinking as compared to drugs.\\nSmoking and drinking once only or very occasionally does not\\nalways lead to addiction. But drugs are very powerful chemicals that\\ncan cause profound alterations in the metabolism of the  body and\\nin the chemistry of the brain. Even a single dose of a powerful drug\\ncan start the addiction process. When one’s mind and body becomes\\naddicted to drugs, stopping drugs produces very unpleasant and\\ndistressing mental and physical symptoms. This makes the addict\\npersist with the usage of the drug. Addicts cannot give up their habit\\nunless they get medical treatment and counselling.\\nYou should not boast about your strong will power and assume that\\nyou can experiment with drugs without becoming addicted. ALWAYS\\nKEEP AWAY from drugs. Do not allow yourself to succumb to\\npressure by friends and acquaintances. If you remain firm in your\\nresolve, you can prevent your life from being ruined.', 'Some Common Human Diseases\\n 287\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nSome Basic Facts\\nWhat are Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs)?\\nRTIs are infections of the upper and lower reproductive tracts of\\nboth sexes. Agents of infection include bacteria, viruses, and\\nprotozoa. Not all RTIs are sexually transmitted; some may occur\\ndue to an imbalance of the bacteria normally found in the reproductive\\ntract and poor personal hygiene.\\nSome Basic Facts\\nIs it possible for a person to have an RTI (Reproductive  Tract\\nInfection) without knowing about it?\\nSymptoms of RTIs in men are visible, and hence they become aware\\nthat their sexual organs have been infected.\\nHowever, RTIs in women sometimes can be asymptomatic. This\\nmeans that signs or symptoms are not experienced even though the\\ninfection is active. Hence women often do not know that they have\\nRTI.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 29.7\\n1.

The concern of the diseases involves\\nthe society as these are related to\\ncommunity health.\\n29.1.2 Modes of Spread of Communicable  Diseases\\nCommunicable diseases spread from the infected person to a healthy person in the\\nfollowing ways.\\nDirect transmission\\nThe pathogens of diseases infect a healthy person directly without an intermediate\\nagent. It can take place by various means such as,\\n(i)\\nDirect contact between the infected person and the healthy person :\\nDiseases like small pox, chicken pox, syphilis, gonorrhoea spread through direct\\ncontact.\\n(ii) Droplet infection : The infected person throws out tiny droplets of mucus by\\ncoughing, sneezing or spitting. These droplets may contain the pathogen. By\\ninhaling the air containing the droplets, a healthy person may get the infection.\\nDiseases like common cold, pneumonia, influenza, measles, tuberculosis and\\nwhooping cough spread through droplet infection.\\nCaused due to some specific factor,\\nsuch as malfunctioning of some vital\\norgan, and deficiency of nutrients.\\nDo not spread from one person to\\nanother by contact.\\nThe concern of the disease is restricted\\nto the individual only.', 'Some Common Human Diseases\\n 267\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\n(iii) Contact with soil contaminated with disease-causing viruses and bacteria.\\n(iv) Animal bite : Viruses of rabies are introduced through the wound caused by\\nthe bite of rabid animals, especially dogs. The virus is present in the saliva of\\nthe rabid animals.\\nIndirect transmission\\nThe pathogens of certain diseases reach the human body through some intermediate\\nagents. It can take place by various means, which are as follows :\\n(i)\\nBy vectors such as houseflies, mosquitoes, and cockroaches. Examples:\\nHouseflies carry the causative organisms of cholera on their legs and mouth\\nparts from the faeces and sputum of infected persons to food and drinks and\\ncontaminate them. When this contaminated food is taken by a healthy person,\\nhe gets the infection. Similarly, mosquitoes carry virus of dengue and malarial\\nparasite which causes malaria.\\n(ii) Air-borne : The pathogens may reach humans with air and dust. The epidemic\\ntyphus spreads by inhalation of dried faeces of infected fly.\\n(iii) Object borne (Fonite borne) : Many diseases are transmitted through the use\\nof contaminated articles, such as clothes, utensils, toys, door handles, taps,\\nsyringes and surgical instruments.\\n(iv) Water borne : If potable water (drinking water) is contaminated with\\npathogens of diseases such as cholera, diarhhoea, hepatitis or jaundice, it\\nreaches a healthy person upon consuming such water.\\n29.2 SOME IMPORTANT TERMS TO REMEMBER\\nPathogen : A living organism which causes a disease.\\nParasite : An organism which gets food and shelter from host.\\nHost : The living body on or inside which the disease-producing organism takes\\nshelter.\\nInfestation : Presence of a large number of parasitic organisms on the surface of\\nbody of the host or on the clothings.\\nVector : It is an organism which harbours a pathogen and may pass it on to another\\nperson to cause a disease (Mosquitoes harbour malarial parasite and transmits it\\nto humans).\\nCarrier : It is an organism which itself does not harbour the pathogen but physically\\ntransmits it to another person (Housefly is the carrier of cholera germs).\\nReservoir : An organism which harbours pathogens in large numbers that do not\\ncause any suffering to it.\\nEpidemic : Spreading of a disease among a large number of people causing a huge\\nloss of life in the same place for some time e.g. plague.\\nEndemic : A disease which is regularly found among a particular group of people\\ne.g. goitre, restricted to a certain locality or a country.', 'Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 268\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nPandemic : A disease which is found all over the world e.g. AIDS.\\nInterferon : Type of proteins produced by infected cells of the body when attacked\\nby a virus, which act to prevent the further development of the same virus.\\nInoculation : Introduction of antigenic material inside the body to prevent suffering\\nfrom a disease.\\nVaccination : Injection of a weak strain of a specific bacterium (Vaccine) in order\\nto secure immunity against the corresponding disease.

Influenza\\nInfluenza, commonly known as ‘flu’ is an illness caused by viruses that infect the\\nrespiratory tract. Compared to common cold, influenza is a more severe illness.\\nCauses\\nInfluenza is caused by a virus which attacks our body’s cells, resulting in various\\neffects depending on the strain of the virus.', 'Some Common Human Diseases\\n 271\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nThere are many strains of influenza virus. The virus mutates all the time and new\\nvariations (strains) arise. This constant changing enables the virus to evade the\\nimmune system of its host. Unfortunately immunity against one strain (which is\\nconferred by exposure or immunisation) does not protect against other strains. A\\nperson infected with influenza virus develops antibodies against that virus; as the\\nvirus changes, the antibodies against the virus do not recognize the changed virus,\\nand influenza can recur, caused by the changed or mutated virus.\\nSymptoms\\nTypical symptoms of influenza include:\\n(i)\\nfever (Usually 100° F to 103° F in adults and often even higher in children).\\n(ii) respiratory tract infection symptoms such as, cough, sore throat, running\\nnose, headache, pain in the muscles, and extreme fatigue.\\nAlthough nausea and vomiting and diarrhoea can sometimes accompany Influenza\\ninfection, especially in children, gastrointestinal symptoms are rarely prominent.\\nMost people who get flu, recover completely in 1 to 2 weeks, but some people\\ndevelop serious and potentially life-threatening complications, such as pneumonia.\\nTreatment and Control\\n(i) Much of the illness and death caused by influenza can be prevented by annual\\ninfluenza vaccination. Influenza vaccine is specifically recommended for those\\nwho are at high risk for complications with chronic diseases of the heart, lungs\\nor kidneys, diabetes, or severe forms of anaemia.\\n(ii) The persons suffering from influenza should\\nz\\ndrink plenty of fluids\\nz\\ntake symptom relief with paracetamol, aspirin (not in children under the\\nage of 16) or ibuprofen as recommended by the doctor.\\nz\\nConsult doctor immediately for treatment.\\n7. Dengue\\nDengue is an acute fever caused by virus. It is of two types: (i) Dengue fever, (ii)\\nDengue hemorrhagic fever.\\nDengue fever is characterized by an onset of sudden high fever, severe headache,\\npain behind the eyes and in the muscles and joints.\\nDengue hemorrhagic fever is an acute infectious viral disease. It is an advanced\\nstage of dengue fever. It is characterized by fever during the initial phase and other\\nsymptoms like headache, pain in the eye, joint pain and muscle pain, followed by\\nsigns of bleeding, red tiny spots on the skin, and bleeding from nose and gums.\\nHow does Dengue spread?\\nDengue spreads through the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito. The\\ntransmission of the disease occurs when a mosquito bites an infected person and\\nsubsequently bites a healthy person. In doing so, it transmits blood containing the', 'Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 272\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nvirus to the healthy person and the person becomes infected with dengue. The first\\nsymptoms of the disease occur about 5 to 7 days after the infected bite.\\nAedes mosquito rests indoors, in closets and other dark places, and is active during\\nday time. Outside, it rests where it is cool and shaded. The female mosquito lays\\nher eggs in stagnant water containers such as coolers, tyres, empty buckets, in and\\naround homes, and other areas in towns or villages. These eggs become adults in\\nabout 10 days.\\nIncubation period\\nThe time between the bite of a mosquito carrying dengue virus and the start of\\nsymptoms averages 4 to 6 days, with a range of 3 to 14 days.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is made through blood tests by scanning for antibodies against dengue\\nviruses. In addition the blood platelet counts also get drastically reduced in the\\ninfected person.\\nSymptoms\\nSymptoms of Dengue fever\\n(i)\\nSudden onset of high fever, generally 104-105 °F (40 °C), which may last 4-\\n5 days.\\n(ii)\\nSevere headache mostly in the forehead.\\n(iii) pain in the joints and muscles, body aches.\\n(iv) Pain behind the eyes which worsens with eye movement.\\n(v)\\nNausea or vomiting.\\nSymptoms of Dengue hemorrhagic fever\\nThese include symptoms similar to dengue fever, plus other symptoms such as:\\n(i)\\nSevere and continuous pain in the abdomen.\\n(ii)\\nRashes on the skin.\\n(iii) Bleeding from the nose, mouth, or in the internal organs.\\n(iv) Frequent vomiting with or without blood.\\n(v)\\nBlack stools due to internal bleeding.\\n(vi) Excessive thirst (dry mouth).\\n(vii) Pale, cold skin, weakness.\\nPrevention\\nFollowing steps can be taken to prevent spread of dengue fever:\\n(i)\\nAvoid water stagnation for more than 72 hours so that the mosquitoes do not\\nbreed there.\\n(ii)\\nPrevent mosquito breeding in stored water bodies, like ponds, and wells.', 'Some Common Human Diseases\\n 273\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\n(iii) Destroy discarded objects like old tyres and bottles, as they collect and store\\nrain water.\\n(iv) Use mosquito repellents and wear long sleeved clothes to curtail exposure.\\n(v)\\nUse mosquito nets, also during daytime.\\n(vi) Avoid outdoor activities during dawn or dusk when these mosquitoes are most\\nactive.\\n(vii) Patients suffering from dengue fever must be isolated for at least 5 days.\\n(viii) Report to the nearest health centre for any suspected case of Dengue fever.\\nTreatment for dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever\\nThere is no specific treatment for dengue fever. Persons with dengue fever should\\nrest and drink plenty of fluids. Dengue hemorrhagic fever is treated by replacing\\nlost fluids.

A\\npharmaceutical preparation or a naturally occurring substance used primarily to alter\\nthe physical or mental functioning of an individual, is called a drug.\\nWhat is drug abuse\\nWhen drugs are taken for medical reasons to treat or cure disease both physical\\nand mental, they are called medications or therapeutic drugs.\\nDrug abuse occurs when drugs are taken without medical reasons and without\\nmedical supervision, especially when they are taken in an amount, strength,\\nfrequency, or manner that damages the physical and mental functioning of the\\nindividual. Cough syrups, pain killers, and tranquillizers are some common medicines\\nthat are often abused.', 'Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 286\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nDrug abuse also occurs when certain chemicals that have no medical use or benefits\\nare taken, such as sniffing glue and solvents. The extent of drug abuse depends on\\nthe quantity of the drug being taken, and the method and frequency of its\\nconsumption. Drug abuse leads to many serious physical, emotional, and social\\nproblems.\\nWhat are the effects of drug abuse?\\nDrug abuse leads to a number of short-term and long-term effects that are\\ndetrimental to health:\\nz\\nShort-term effects : These are the effects that appear instantly or a few minutes\\nafter the intake of drugs. The effects include a sense of well-being and a pleasant\\ndrowsiness.\\nz\\nLong-term effects :  Constant and excessive use of drugs over a long period\\ncan cause both physical and mental damage and illness. This includes failure in\\nacademic studies, employment, and interpersonal relationship; financial ruin;\\nincreased risk of contracting STIs; and increased risk of being involved in\\nvehicular accidents. Addicts stop thinking of everything in life except when and\\nhow they will get their next drug dose. They will do anything for the dose,\\nincluding committing crimes such as theft and in certain case even murder.\\nSome Basic Facts\\nTeenagers sometimes try a smoke or drink just to see how it\\nfeels, but they do not start using drugs on a regular basis. What\\nis the harm in trying drugs just to see how it feels?\\nIdeally, there is no need to try out a smoke or drink.\\nBut there is a great difference between “ trying out” smoking  or\\ndrinking as compared to drugs.\\nSmoking and drinking once only or very occasionally does not\\nalways lead to addiction. But drugs are very powerful chemicals that\\ncan cause profound alterations in the metabolism of the  body and\\nin the chemistry of the brain. Even a single dose of a powerful drug\\ncan start the addiction process. When one’s mind and body becomes\\naddicted to drugs, stopping drugs produces very unpleasant and\\ndistressing mental and physical symptoms. This makes the addict\\npersist with the usage of the drug. Addicts cannot give up their habit\\nunless they get medical treatment and counselling.\\nYou should not boast about your strong will power and assume that\\nyou can experiment with drugs without becoming addicted. ALWAYS\\nKEEP AWAY from drugs. Do not allow yourself to succumb to\\npressure by friends and acquaintances. If you remain firm in your\\nresolve, you can prevent your life from being ruined.', 'Some Common Human Diseases\\n 287\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nSome Basic Facts\\nWhat are Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs)?\\nRTIs are infections of the upper and lower reproductive tracts of\\nboth sexes. Agents of infection include bacteria, viruses, and\\nprotozoa. Not all RTIs are sexually transmitted; some may occur\\ndue to an imbalance of the bacteria normally found in the reproductive\\ntract and poor personal hygiene.\\nSome Basic Facts\\nIs it possible for a person to have an RTI (Reproductive  Tract\\nInfection) without knowing about it?\\nSymptoms of RTIs in men are visible, and hence they become aware\\nthat their sexual organs have been infected.\\nHowever, RTIs in women sometimes can be asymptomatic. This\\nmeans that signs or symptoms are not experienced even though the\\ninfection is active. Hence women often do not know that they have\\nRTI.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 29.7\\n1.

It can take place by various means, which are as follows :\\n(i)\\nBy vectors such as houseflies, mosquitoes, and cockroaches. Examples:\\nHouseflies carry the causative organisms of cholera on their legs and mouth\\nparts from the faeces and sputum of infected persons to food and drinks and\\ncontaminate them. When this contaminated food is taken by a healthy person,\\nhe gets the infection. Similarly, mosquitoes carry virus of dengue and malarial\\nparasite which causes malaria.\\n(ii) Air-borne : The pathogens may reach humans with air and dust. The epidemic\\ntyphus spreads by inhalation of dried faeces of infected fly.\\n(iii) Object borne (Fonite borne) : Many diseases are transmitted through the use\\nof contaminated articles, such as clothes, utensils, toys, door handles, taps,\\nsyringes and surgical instruments.\\n(iv) Water borne : If potable water (drinking water) is contaminated with\\npathogens of diseases such as cholera, diarhhoea, hepatitis or jaundice, it\\nreaches a healthy person upon consuming such water.\\n29.2 SOME IMPORTANT TERMS TO REMEMBER\\nPathogen : A living organism which causes a disease.\\nParasite : An organism which gets food and shelter from host.\\nHost : The living body on or inside which the disease-producing organism takes\\nshelter.\\nInfestation : Presence of a large number of parasitic organisms on the surface of\\nbody of the host or on the clothings.\\nVector : It is an organism which harbours a pathogen and may pass it on to another\\nperson to cause a disease (Mosquitoes harbour malarial parasite and transmits it\\nto humans).\\nCarrier : It is an organism which itself does not harbour the pathogen but physically\\ntransmits it to another person (Housefly is the carrier of cholera germs).\\nReservoir : An organism which harbours pathogens in large numbers that do not\\ncause any suffering to it.\\nEpidemic : Spreading of a disease among a large number of people causing a huge\\nloss of life in the same place for some time e.g. plague.\\nEndemic : A disease which is regularly found among a particular group of people\\ne.g. goitre, restricted to a certain locality or a country.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 268\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nPandemic : A disease which is found all over the world e.g. AIDS.\\nInterferon : Type of proteins produced by infected cells of the body when attacked\\nby a virus, which act to prevent the further development of the same virus.\\nInoculation : Introduction of antigenic material inside the body to prevent suffering\\nfrom a disease.\\nVaccination : Injection of a weak strain of a specific bacterium (Vaccine) in order\\nto secure immunity against the corresponding disease.

The virus mutates all the time and new\\nvariations (strains) arise. This constant changing enables the virus to evade the\\nimmune system of its host. Unfortunately immunity against one strain (which is\\nconferred by exposure or immunisation) does not protect against other strains. A\\nperson infected with influenza virus develops antibodies against that virus; as the\\nvirus changes, the antibodies against the virus do not recognize the changed virus,\\nand influenza can recur, caused by the changed or mutated virus.\\nSymptoms\\nTypical symptoms of influenza include:\\n(i)\\nfever (Usually 100° F to 103° F in adults and often even higher in children).\\n(ii) respiratory tract infection symptoms such as, cough, sore throat, running\\nnose, headache, pain in the muscles, and extreme fatigue.\\nAlthough nausea and vomiting and diarrhoea can sometimes accompany Influenza\\ninfection, especially in children, gastrointestinal symptoms are rarely prominent.\\nMost people who get flu, recover completely in 1 to 2 weeks, but some people\\ndevelop serious and potentially life-threatening complications, such as pneumonia.\\nTreatment and Control\\n(i) Much of the illness and death caused by influenza can be prevented by annual\\ninfluenza vaccination. Influenza vaccine is specifically recommended for those\\nwho are at high risk for complications with chronic diseases of the heart, lungs\\nor kidneys, diabetes, or severe forms of anaemia.\\n(ii) The persons suffering from influenza should\\nz\\ndrink plenty of fluids\\nz\\ntake symptom relief with paracetamol, aspirin (not in children under the\\nage of 16) or ibuprofen as recommended by the doctor.\\nz\\nConsult doctor immediately for treatment.\\n7. Dengue\\nDengue is an acute fever caused by virus. It is of two types: (i) Dengue fever, (ii)\\nDengue hemorrhagic fever.\\nDengue fever is characterized by an onset of sudden high fever, severe headache,\\npain behind the eyes and in the muscles and joints.\\nDengue hemorrhagic fever is an acute infectious viral disease. It is an advanced\\nstage of dengue fever. It is characterized by fever during the initial phase and other\\nsymptoms like headache, pain in the eye, joint pain and muscle pain, followed by\\nsigns of bleeding, red tiny spots on the skin, and bleeding from nose and gums.\\nHow does Dengue spread?\\nDengue spreads through the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito. The\\ntransmission of the disease occurs when a mosquito bites an infected person and\\nsubsequently bites a healthy person. In doing so, it transmits blood containing the'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 272\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nvirus to the healthy person and the person becomes infected with dengue. The first\\nsymptoms of the disease occur about 5 to 7 days after the infected bite.\\nAedes mosquito rests indoors, in closets and other dark places, and is active during\\nday time. Outside, it rests where it is cool and shaded.

The extent of drug abuse depends on\\nthe quantity of the drug being taken, and the method and frequency of its\\nconsumption. Drug abuse leads to many serious physical, emotional, and social\\nproblems.\\nWhat are the effects of drug abuse?\\nDrug abuse leads to a number of short-term and long-term effects that are\\ndetrimental to health:\\nz\\nShort-term effects : These are the effects that appear instantly or a few minutes\\nafter the intake of drugs. The effects include a sense of well-being and a pleasant\\ndrowsiness.\\nz\\nLong-term effects :  Constant and excessive use of drugs over a long period\\ncan cause both physical and mental damage and illness. This includes failure in\\nacademic studies, employment, and interpersonal relationship; financial ruin;\\nincreased risk of contracting STIs; and increased risk of being involved in\\nvehicular accidents.

They will do anything for the dose,\\nincluding committing crimes such as theft and in certain case even murder.\\nSome Basic Facts\\nTeenagers sometimes try a smoke or drink just to see how it\\nfeels, but they do not start using drugs on a regular basis. What\\nis the harm in trying drugs just to see how it feels?\\nIdeally, there is no need to try out a smoke or drink.\\nBut there is a great difference between “ trying out” smoking  or\\ndrinking as compared to drugs.\\nSmoking and drinking once only or very occasionally does not\\nalways lead to addiction. But drugs are very powerful chemicals that\\ncan cause profound alterations in the metabolism of the  body and\\nin the chemistry of the brain. Even a single dose of a powerful drug\\ncan start the addiction process. When one’s mind and body becomes\\naddicted to drugs, stopping drugs produces very unpleasant and\\ndistressing mental and physical symptoms. This makes the addict\\npersist with the usage of the drug. Addicts cannot give up their habit\\nunless they get medical treatment and counselling.\\nYou should not boast about your strong will power and assume that\\nyou can experiment with drugs without becoming addicted.

In other words, disease may be defined as a disorder in the physical,\\nphysiological, psychological or social state of a person caused due to nutritional\\ndeficiency, physiological disorder, genetic disorder, pathogen or any other reason.\\n29.1.1 Types of Diseases\\nThe diseases may be classified into two broad categories (Table 29.1).\\nTable 29.1 Classification of human diseases\\nDiseases\\nCongenital diseases\\nAcquired diseases\\n(Present since birth)\\n(Develop after birth)\\nCommunicable diseases\\nNon-communicable diseases\\n(Spread from infected person\\n(do not spread from a diseased person\\nto healthy person\\nto a healthy person)\\nDegenerative\\nDeficiency\\nAllergies\\nCancer\\nOther diseases\\ndiseases\\ndiseases\\n(caused due to\\n(caused due to\\n(caused due to\\n(caused due to\\n(caused due to\\nhypersensitivity uncontrolled\\nvarious physical\\nmalfunctioning\\nlack of nutrients of the body to\\ngrowth of cells/\\nagents or any\\nof vital body\\nin diet)\\ncertain foreign\\ntissues)\\nother reason)\\norgan)\\nsubstances)\\nA. Congenital disease : The disease which is present from birth (e.g. hole in the\\nheart in infants). They are caused by some genetic abnormality or metabolic\\ndisorder or malfunctioning of an organ.\\nB. Acquired disease : The disease which may occur after birth during one’s\\nlifetime.\\nAcquired diseases may generally be classified into :\\n(i)\\nInfectious diseases : The diseases which can be transmitted from diseased\\nhealthy person person to e.g. measles.\\n(ii) Degenerative diseases : The diseases caused by the malfunction of some vital\\norgans of the body e.g. heart failure.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 266\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\n(iii) Deficiency diseases : These are caused due to nutritional deficiency such as\\nthat of minerals or vitamins in the diet e.g. anaemia (Fe), Beri- beri (vitamin\\nB). You have read about such diseases in an earlier lesson 27.\\n(iv) Cancer : This is an abnormal, uncontrolled and unwanted growth of cells. e.g.\\nbreast cancer.\\nAcquired diseases are studied under two categories (Table 29.2).\\n(i)\\nCommunicable diseases : The diseases which can be transmitted from\\nan infected person to a healthy person.\\n(ii)\\nNon-communicable diseases : These diseases do not spread from an\\naffected person to a healthy person.\\nTable 29.2 Differences between communicable and\\nnon-communicable diseases\\nCommunicable diseases\\nNon-communicable diseases\\n1.

The concern of the diseases involves\\nthe society as these are related to\\ncommunity health.\\n29.1.2 Modes of Spread of Communicable  Diseases\\nCommunicable diseases spread from the infected person to a healthy person in the\\nfollowing ways.\\nDirect transmission\\nThe pathogens of diseases infect a healthy person directly without an intermediate\\nagent. It can take place by various means such as,\\n(i)\\nDirect contact between the infected person and the healthy person :\\nDiseases like small pox, chicken pox, syphilis, gonorrhoea spread through direct\\ncontact.\\n(ii) Droplet infection : The infected person throws out tiny droplets of mucus by\\ncoughing, sneezing or spitting. These droplets may contain the pathogen. By\\ninhaling the air containing the droplets, a healthy person may get the infection.\\nDiseases like common cold, pneumonia, influenza, measles, tuberculosis and\\nwhooping cough spread through droplet infection.\\nCaused due to some specific factor,\\nsuch as malfunctioning of some vital\\norgan, and deficiency of nutrients.\\nDo not spread from one person to\\nanother by contact.\\nThe concern of the disease is restricted\\nto the individual only.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\n 267\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\n(iii) Contact with soil contaminated with disease-causing viruses and bacteria.\\n(iv) Animal bite : Viruses of rabies are introduced through the wound caused by\\nthe bite of rabid animals, especially dogs. The virus is present in the saliva of\\nthe rabid animals.\\nIndirect transmission\\nThe pathogens of certain diseases reach the human body through some intermediate\\nagents. It can take place by various means, which are as follows :\\n(i)\\nBy vectors such as houseflies, mosquitoes, and cockroaches. Examples:\\nHouseflies carry the causative organisms of cholera on their legs and mouth\\nparts from the faeces and sputum of infected persons to food and drinks and\\ncontaminate them. When this contaminated food is taken by a healthy person,\\nhe gets the infection. Similarly, mosquitoes carry virus of dengue and malarial\\nparasite which causes malaria.\\n(ii) Air-borne : The pathogens may reach humans with air and dust. The epidemic\\ntyphus spreads by inhalation of dried faeces of infected fly.\\n(iii) Object borne (Fonite borne) : Many diseases are transmitted through the use\\nof contaminated articles, such as clothes, utensils, toys, door handles, taps,\\nsyringes and surgical instruments.\\n(iv) Water borne : If potable water (drinking water) is contaminated with\\npathogens of diseases such as cholera, diarhhoea, hepatitis or jaundice, it\\nreaches a healthy person upon consuming such water.\\n29.2 SOME IMPORTANT TERMS TO REMEMBER\\nPathogen : A living organism which causes a disease.\\nParasite : An organism which gets food and shelter from host.\\nHost : The living body on or inside which the disease-producing organism takes\\nshelter.\\nInfestation : Presence of a large number of parasitic organisms on the surface of\\nbody of the host or on the clothings.\\nVector : It is an organism which harbours a pathogen and may pass it on to another\\nperson to cause a disease (Mosquitoes harbour malarial parasite and transmits it\\nto humans).\\nCarrier : It is an organism which itself does not harbour the pathogen but physically\\ntransmits it to another person (Housefly is the carrier of cholera germs).\\nReservoir : An organism which harbours pathogens in large numbers that do not\\ncause any suffering to it.\\nEpidemic : Spreading of a disease among a large number of people causing a huge\\nloss of life in the same place for some time e.g. plague.\\nEndemic : A disease which is regularly found among a particular group of people\\ne.g. goitre, restricted to a certain locality or a country.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 268\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nPandemic : A disease which is found all over the world e.g. AIDS.\\nInterferon : Type of proteins produced by infected cells of the body when attacked\\nby a virus, which act to prevent the further development of the same virus.\\nInoculation : Introduction of antigenic material inside the body to prevent suffering\\nfrom a disease.\\nVaccination : Injection of a weak strain of a specific bacterium (Vaccine) in order\\nto secure immunity against the corresponding disease.

Influenza\\nInfluenza, commonly known as ‘flu’ is an illness caused by viruses that infect the\\nrespiratory tract. Compared to common cold, influenza is a more severe illness.\\nCauses\\nInfluenza is caused by a virus which attacks our body’s cells, resulting in various\\neffects depending on the strain of the virus.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\n 271\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nThere are many strains of influenza virus. The virus mutates all the time and new\\nvariations (strains) arise. This constant changing enables the virus to evade the\\nimmune system of its host. Unfortunately immunity against one strain (which is\\nconferred by exposure or immunisation) does not protect against other strains. A\\nperson infected with influenza virus develops antibodies against that virus; as the\\nvirus changes, the antibodies against the virus do not recognize the changed virus,\\nand influenza can recur, caused by the changed or mutated virus.\\nSymptoms\\nTypical symptoms of influenza include:\\n(i)\\nfever (Usually 100° F to 103° F in adults and often even higher in children).\\n(ii) respiratory tract infection symptoms such as, cough, sore throat, running\\nnose, headache, pain in the muscles, and extreme fatigue.\\nAlthough nausea and vomiting and diarrhoea can sometimes accompany Influenza\\ninfection, especially in children, gastrointestinal symptoms are rarely prominent.\\nMost people who get flu, recover completely in 1 to 2 weeks, but some people\\ndevelop serious and potentially life-threatening complications, such as pneumonia.\\nTreatment and Control\\n(i) Much of the illness and death caused by influenza can be prevented by annual\\ninfluenza vaccination. Influenza vaccine is specifically recommended for those\\nwho are at high risk for complications with chronic diseases of the heart, lungs\\nor kidneys, diabetes, or severe forms of anaemia.\\n(ii) The persons suffering from influenza should\\nz\\ndrink plenty of fluids\\nz\\ntake symptom relief with paracetamol, aspirin (not in children under the\\nage of 16) or ibuprofen as recommended by the doctor.\\nz\\nConsult doctor immediately for treatment.\\n7. Dengue\\nDengue is an acute fever caused by virus. It is of two types: (i) Dengue fever, (ii)\\nDengue hemorrhagic fever.\\nDengue fever is characterized by an onset of sudden high fever, severe headache,\\npain behind the eyes and in the muscles and joints.\\nDengue hemorrhagic fever is an acute infectious viral disease. It is an advanced\\nstage of dengue fever. It is characterized by fever during the initial phase and other\\nsymptoms like headache, pain in the eye, joint pain and muscle pain, followed by\\nsigns of bleeding, red tiny spots on the skin, and bleeding from nose and gums.\\nHow does Dengue spread?\\nDengue spreads through the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito. The\\ntransmission of the disease occurs when a mosquito bites an infected person and\\nsubsequently bites a healthy person. In doing so, it transmits blood containing the'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 272\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nvirus to the healthy person and the person becomes infected with dengue. The first\\nsymptoms of the disease occur about 5 to 7 days after the infected bite.\\nAedes mosquito rests indoors, in closets and other dark places, and is active during\\nday time. Outside, it rests where it is cool and shaded. The female mosquito lays\\nher eggs in stagnant water containers such as coolers, tyres, empty buckets, in and\\naround homes, and other areas in towns or villages. These eggs become adults in\\nabout 10 days.\\nIncubation period\\nThe time between the bite of a mosquito carrying dengue virus and the start of\\nsymptoms averages 4 to 6 days, with a range of 3 to 14 days.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is made through blood tests by scanning for antibodies against dengue\\nviruses. In addition the blood platelet counts also get drastically reduced in the\\ninfected person.\\nSymptoms\\nSymptoms of Dengue fever\\n(i)\\nSudden onset of high fever, generally 104-105 °F (40 °C), which may last 4-\\n5 days.\\n(ii)\\nSevere headache mostly in the forehead.\\n(iii) pain in the joints and muscles, body aches.\\n(iv) Pain behind the eyes which worsens with eye movement.\\n(v)\\nNausea or vomiting.\\nSymptoms of Dengue hemorrhagic fever\\nThese include symptoms similar to dengue fever, plus other symptoms such as:\\n(i)\\nSevere and continuous pain in the abdomen.\\n(ii)\\nRashes on the skin.\\n(iii) Bleeding from the nose, mouth, or in the internal organs.\\n(iv) Frequent vomiting with or without blood.\\n(v)\\nBlack stools due to internal bleeding.\\n(vi) Excessive thirst (dry mouth).\\n(vii) Pale, cold skin, weakness.\\nPrevention\\nFollowing steps can be taken to prevent spread of dengue fever:\\n(i)\\nAvoid water stagnation for more than 72 hours so that the mosquitoes do not\\nbreed there.\\n(ii)\\nPrevent mosquito breeding in stored water bodies, like ponds, and wells.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\n 273\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\n(iii) Destroy discarded objects like old tyres and bottles, as they collect and store\\nrain water.\\n(iv) Use mosquito repellents and wear long sleeved clothes to curtail exposure.\\n(v)\\nUse mosquito nets, also during daytime.\\n(vi) Avoid outdoor activities during dawn or dusk when these mosquitoes are most\\nactive.\\n(vii) Patients suffering from dengue fever must be isolated for at least 5 days.\\n(viii) Report to the nearest health centre for any suspected case of Dengue fever.\\nTreatment for dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever\\nThere is no specific treatment for dengue fever.

A\\npharmaceutical preparation or a naturally occurring substance used primarily to alter\\nthe physical or mental functioning of an individual, is called a drug.\\nWhat is drug abuse\\nWhen drugs are taken for medical reasons to treat or cure disease both physical\\nand mental, they are called medications or therapeutic drugs.\\nDrug abuse occurs when drugs are taken without medical reasons and without\\nmedical supervision, especially when they are taken in an amount, strength,\\nfrequency, or manner that damages the physical and mental functioning of the\\nindividual. Cough syrups, pain killers, and tranquillizers are some common medicines\\nthat are often abused.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 286\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nDrug abuse also occurs when certain chemicals that have no medical use or benefits\\nare taken, such as sniffing glue and solvents. The extent of drug abuse depends on\\nthe quantity of the drug being taken, and the method and frequency of its\\nconsumption. Drug abuse leads to many serious physical, emotional, and social\\nproblems.\\nWhat are the effects of drug abuse?\\nDrug abuse leads to a number of short-term and long-term effects that are\\ndetrimental to health:\\nz\\nShort-term effects : These are the effects that appear instantly or a few minutes\\nafter the intake of drugs. The effects include a sense of well-being and a pleasant\\ndrowsiness.\\nz\\nLong-term effects :  Constant and excessive use of drugs over a long period\\ncan cause both physical and mental damage and illness. This includes failure in\\nacademic studies, employment, and interpersonal relationship; financial ruin;\\nincreased risk of contracting STIs; and increased risk of being involved in\\nvehicular accidents. Addicts stop thinking of everything in life except when and\\nhow they will get their next drug dose. They will do anything for the dose,\\nincluding committing crimes such as theft and in certain case even murder.\\nSome Basic Facts\\nTeenagers sometimes try a smoke or drink just to see how it\\nfeels, but they do not start using drugs on a regular basis. What\\nis the harm in trying drugs just to see how it feels?\\nIdeally, there is no need to try out a smoke or drink.\\nBut there is a great difference between “ trying out” smoking  or\\ndrinking as compared to drugs.\\nSmoking and drinking once only or very occasionally does not\\nalways lead to addiction. But drugs are very powerful chemicals that\\ncan cause profound alterations in the metabolism of the  body and\\nin the chemistry of the brain. Even a single dose of a powerful drug\\ncan start the addiction process. When one’s mind and body becomes\\naddicted to drugs, stopping drugs produces very unpleasant and\\ndistressing mental and physical symptoms. This makes the addict\\npersist with the usage of the drug. Addicts cannot give up their habit\\nunless they get medical treatment and counselling.\\nYou should not boast about your strong will power and assume that\\nyou can experiment with drugs without becoming addicted.

Influenza\\nInfluenza, commonly known as ‘flu’ is an illness caused by viruses that infect the\\nrespiratory tract. Compared to common cold, influenza is a more severe illness.\\nCauses\\nInfluenza is caused by a virus which attacks our body’s cells, resulting in various\\neffects depending on the strain of the virus.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\n 271\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nThere are many strains of influenza virus. The virus mutates all the time and new\\nvariations (strains) arise. This constant changing enables the virus to evade the\\nimmune system of its host. Unfortunately immunity against one strain (which is\\nconferred by exposure or immunisation) does not protect against other strains. A\\nperson infected with influenza virus develops antibodies against that virus; as the\\nvirus changes, the antibodies against the virus do not recognize the changed virus,\\nand influenza can recur, caused by the changed or mutated virus.\\nSymptoms\\nTypical symptoms of influenza include:\\n(i)\\nfever (Usually 100° F to 103° F in adults and often even higher in children).\\n(ii) respiratory tract infection symptoms such as, cough, sore throat, running\\nnose, headache, pain in the muscles, and extreme fatigue.\\nAlthough nausea and vomiting and diarrhoea can sometimes accompany Influenza\\ninfection, especially in children, gastrointestinal symptoms are rarely prominent.\\nMost people who get flu, recover completely in 1 to 2 weeks, but some people\\ndevelop serious and potentially life-threatening complications, such as pneumonia.\\nTreatment and Control\\n(i) Much of the illness and death caused by influenza can be prevented by annual\\ninfluenza vaccination. Influenza vaccine is specifically recommended for those\\nwho are at high risk for complications with chronic diseases of the heart, lungs\\nor kidneys, diabetes, or severe forms of anaemia.\\n(ii) The persons suffering from influenza should\\nz\\ndrink plenty of fluids\\nz\\ntake symptom relief with paracetamol, aspirin (not in children under the\\nage of 16) or ibuprofen as recommended by the doctor.\\nz\\nConsult doctor immediately for treatment.\\n7. Dengue\\nDengue is an acute fever caused by virus. It is of two types: (i) Dengue fever, (ii)\\nDengue hemorrhagic fever.\\nDengue fever is characterized by an onset of sudden high fever, severe headache,\\npain behind the eyes and in the muscles and joints.\\nDengue hemorrhagic fever is an acute infectious viral disease. It is an advanced\\nstage of dengue fever. It is characterized by fever during the initial phase and other\\nsymptoms like headache, pain in the eye, joint pain and muscle pain, followed by\\nsigns of bleeding, red tiny spots on the skin, and bleeding from nose and gums.\\nHow does Dengue spread?\\nDengue spreads through the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito. The\\ntransmission of the disease occurs when a mosquito bites an infected person and\\nsubsequently bites a healthy person. In doing so, it transmits blood containing the'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 272\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nvirus to the healthy person and the person becomes infected with dengue. The first\\nsymptoms of the disease occur about 5 to 7 days after the infected bite.\\nAedes mosquito rests indoors, in closets and other dark places, and is active during\\nday time. Outside, it rests where it is cool and shaded. The female mosquito lays\\nher eggs in stagnant water containers such as coolers, tyres, empty buckets, in and\\naround homes, and other areas in towns or villages. These eggs become adults in\\nabout 10 days.\\nIncubation period\\nThe time between the bite of a mosquito carrying dengue virus and the start of\\nsymptoms averages 4 to 6 days, with a range of 3 to 14 days.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is made through blood tests by scanning for antibodies against dengue\\nviruses. In addition the blood platelet counts also get drastically reduced in the\\ninfected person.\\nSymptoms\\nSymptoms of Dengue fever\\n(i)\\nSudden onset of high fever, generally 104-105 °F (40 °C), which may last 4-\\n5 days.\\n(ii)\\nSevere headache mostly in the forehead.\\n(iii) pain in the joints and muscles, body aches.\\n(iv) Pain behind the eyes which worsens with eye movement.\\n(v)\\nNausea or vomiting.\\nSymptoms of Dengue hemorrhagic fever\\nThese include symptoms similar to dengue fever, plus other symptoms such as:\\n(i)\\nSevere and continuous pain in the abdomen.\\n(ii)\\nRashes on the skin.\\n(iii) Bleeding from the nose, mouth, or in the internal organs.\\n(iv) Frequent vomiting with or without blood.\\n(v)\\nBlack stools due to internal bleeding.\\n(vi) Excessive thirst (dry mouth).\\n(vii) Pale, cold skin, weakness.\\nPrevention\\nFollowing steps can be taken to prevent spread of dengue fever:\\n(i)\\nAvoid water stagnation for more than 72 hours so that the mosquitoes do not\\nbreed there.\\n(ii)\\nPrevent mosquito breeding in stored water bodies, like ponds, and wells.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\n 273\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\n(iii) Destroy discarded objects like old tyres and bottles, as they collect and store\\nrain water.\\n(iv) Use mosquito repellents and wear long sleeved clothes to curtail exposure.\\n(v)\\nUse mosquito nets, also during daytime.\\n(vi) Avoid outdoor activities during dawn or dusk when these mosquitoes are most\\nactive.\\n(vii) Patients suffering from dengue fever must be isolated for at least 5 days.\\n(viii) Report to the nearest health centre for any suspected case of Dengue fever.\\nTreatment for dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever\\nThere is no specific treatment for dengue fever.

The extent of drug abuse depends on\\nthe quantity of the drug being taken, and the method and frequency of its\\nconsumption. Drug abuse leads to many serious physical, emotional, and social\\nproblems.\\nWhat are the effects of drug abuse?\\nDrug abuse leads to a number of short-term and long-term effects that are\\ndetrimental to health:\\nz\\nShort-term effects : These are the effects that appear instantly or a few minutes\\nafter the intake of drugs. The effects include a sense of well-being and a pleasant\\ndrowsiness.\\nz\\nLong-term effects :  Constant and excessive use of drugs over a long period\\ncan cause both physical and mental damage and illness. This includes failure in\\nacademic studies, employment, and interpersonal relationship; financial ruin;\\nincreased risk of contracting STIs; and increased risk of being involved in\\nvehicular accidents. Addicts stop thinking of everything in life except when and\\nhow they will get their next drug dose. They will do anything for the dose,\\nincluding committing crimes such as theft and in certain case even murder.\\nSome Basic Facts\\nTeenagers sometimes try a smoke or drink just to see how it\\nfeels, but they do not start using drugs on a regular basis. What\\nis the harm in trying drugs just to see how it feels?\\nIdeally, there is no need to try out a smoke or drink.\\nBut there is a great difference between “ trying out” smoking  or\\ndrinking as compared to drugs.\\nSmoking and drinking once only or very occasionally does not\\nalways lead to addiction. But drugs are very powerful chemicals that\\ncan cause profound alterations in the metabolism of the  body and\\nin the chemistry of the brain. Even a single dose of a powerful drug\\ncan start the addiction process. When one’s mind and body becomes\\naddicted to drugs, stopping drugs produces very unpleasant and\\ndistressing mental and physical symptoms.

It can take place by various means such as,\\n(i)\\nDirect contact between the infected person and the healthy person :\\nDiseases like small pox, chicken pox, syphilis, gonorrhoea spread through direct\\ncontact.\\n(ii) Droplet infection : The infected person throws out tiny droplets of mucus by\\ncoughing, sneezing or spitting. These droplets may contain the pathogen. By\\ninhaling the air containing the droplets, a healthy person may get the infection.\\nDiseases like common cold, pneumonia, influenza, measles, tuberculosis and\\nwhooping cough spread through droplet infection.\\nCaused due to some specific factor,\\nsuch as malfunctioning of some vital\\norgan, and deficiency of nutrients.\\nDo not spread from one person to\\nanother by contact.\\nThe concern of the disease is restricted\\nto the individual only.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\n 267\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\n(iii) Contact with soil contaminated with disease-causing viruses and bacteria.\\n(iv) Animal bite : Viruses of rabies are introduced through the wound caused by\\nthe bite of rabid animals, especially dogs. The virus is present in the saliva of\\nthe rabid animals.\\nIndirect transmission\\nThe pathogens of certain diseases reach the human body through some intermediate\\nagents. It can take place by various means, which are as follows :\\n(i)\\nBy vectors such as houseflies, mosquitoes, and cockroaches. Examples:\\nHouseflies carry the causative organisms of cholera on their legs and mouth\\nparts from the faeces and sputum of infected persons to food and drinks and\\ncontaminate them. When this contaminated food is taken by a healthy person,\\nhe gets the infection. Similarly, mosquitoes carry virus of dengue and malarial\\nparasite which causes malaria.\\n(ii) Air-borne : The pathogens may reach humans with air and dust. The epidemic\\ntyphus spreads by inhalation of dried faeces of infected fly.\\n(iii) Object borne (Fonite borne) : Many diseases are transmitted through the use\\nof contaminated articles, such as clothes, utensils, toys, door handles, taps,\\nsyringes and surgical instruments.\\n(iv) Water borne : If potable water (drinking water) is contaminated with\\npathogens of diseases such as cholera, diarhhoea, hepatitis or jaundice, it\\nreaches a healthy person upon consuming such water.\\n29.2 SOME IMPORTANT TERMS TO REMEMBER\\nPathogen : A living organism which causes a disease.\\nParasite : An organism which gets food and shelter from host.\\nHost : The living body on or inside which the disease-producing organism takes\\nshelter.\\nInfestation : Presence of a large number of parasitic organisms on the surface of\\nbody of the host or on the clothings.\\nVector : It is an organism which harbours a pathogen and may pass it on to another\\nperson to cause a disease (Mosquitoes harbour malarial parasite and transmits it\\nto humans).\\nCarrier : It is an organism which itself does not harbour the pathogen but physically\\ntransmits it to another person (Housefly is the carrier of cholera germs).\\nReservoir : An organism which harbours pathogens in large numbers that do not\\ncause any suffering to it.\\nEpidemic : Spreading of a disease among a large number of people causing a huge\\nloss of life in the same place for some time e.g. plague.\\nEndemic : A disease which is regularly found among a particular group of people\\ne.g. goitre, restricted to a certain locality or a country.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 268\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nPandemic : A disease which is found all over the world e.g. AIDS.\\nInterferon : Type of proteins produced by infected cells of the body when attacked\\nby a virus, which act to prevent the further development of the same virus.\\nInoculation : Introduction of antigenic material inside the body to prevent suffering\\nfrom a disease.\\nVaccination : Injection of a weak strain of a specific bacterium (Vaccine) in order\\nto secure immunity against the corresponding disease.

The virus mutates all the time and new\\nvariations (strains) arise. This constant changing enables the virus to evade the\\nimmune system of its host. Unfortunately immunity against one strain (which is\\nconferred by exposure or immunisation) does not protect against other strains. A\\nperson infected with influenza virus develops antibodies against that virus; as the\\nvirus changes, the antibodies against the virus do not recognize the changed virus,\\nand influenza can recur, caused by the changed or mutated virus.\\nSymptoms\\nTypical symptoms of influenza include:\\n(i)\\nfever (Usually 100° F to 103° F in adults and often even higher in children).\\n(ii) respiratory tract infection symptoms such as, cough, sore throat, running\\nnose, headache, pain in the muscles, and extreme fatigue.\\nAlthough nausea and vomiting and diarrhoea can sometimes accompany Influenza\\ninfection, especially in children, gastrointestinal symptoms are rarely prominent.\\nMost people who get flu, recover completely in 1 to 2 weeks, but some people\\ndevelop serious and potentially life-threatening complications, such as pneumonia.\\nTreatment and Control\\n(i) Much of the illness and death caused by influenza can be prevented by annual\\ninfluenza vaccination.

Dengue\\nDengue is an acute fever caused by virus. It is of two types: (i) Dengue fever, (ii)\\nDengue hemorrhagic fever.\\nDengue fever is characterized by an onset of sudden high fever, severe headache,\\npain behind the eyes and in the muscles and joints.\\nDengue hemorrhagic fever is an acute infectious viral disease. It is an advanced\\nstage of dengue fever. It is characterized by fever during the initial phase and other\\nsymptoms like headache, pain in the eye, joint pain and muscle pain, followed by\\nsigns of bleeding, red tiny spots on the skin, and bleeding from nose and gums.\\nHow does Dengue spread?\\nDengue spreads through the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito. The\\ntransmission of the disease occurs when a mosquito bites an infected person and\\nsubsequently bites a healthy person. In doing so, it transmits blood containing the'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 272\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nvirus to the healthy person and the person becomes infected with dengue. The first\\nsymptoms of the disease occur about 5 to 7 days after the infected bite.\\nAedes mosquito rests indoors, in closets and other dark places, and is active during\\nday time. Outside, it rests where it is cool and shaded. The female mosquito lays\\nher eggs in stagnant water containers such as coolers, tyres, empty buckets, in and\\naround homes, and other areas in towns or villages. These eggs become adults in\\nabout 10 days.\\nIncubation period\\nThe time between the bite of a mosquito carrying dengue virus and the start of\\nsymptoms averages 4 to 6 days, with a range of 3 to 14 days.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is made through blood tests by scanning for antibodies against dengue\\nviruses. In addition the blood platelet counts also get drastically reduced in the\\ninfected person.\\nSymptoms\\nSymptoms of Dengue fever\\n(i)\\nSudden onset of high fever, generally 104-105 °F (40 °C), which may last 4-\\n5 days.\\n(ii)\\nSevere headache mostly in the forehead.\\n(iii) pain in the joints and muscles, body aches.\\n(iv) Pain behind the eyes which worsens with eye movement.\\n(v)\\nNausea or vomiting.\\nSymptoms of Dengue hemorrhagic fever\\nThese include symptoms similar to dengue fever, plus other symptoms such as:\\n(i)\\nSevere and continuous pain in the abdomen.\\n(ii)\\nRashes on the skin.\\n(iii) Bleeding from the nose, mouth, or in the internal organs.\\n(iv) Frequent vomiting with or without blood.\\n(v)\\nBlack stools due to internal bleeding.\\n(vi) Excessive thirst (dry mouth).\\n(vii) Pale, cold skin, weakness.\\nPrevention\\nFollowing steps can be taken to prevent spread of dengue fever:\\n(i)\\nAvoid water stagnation for more than 72 hours so that the mosquitoes do not\\nbreed there.\\n(ii)\\nPrevent mosquito breeding in stored water bodies, like ponds, and wells.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\n 273\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\n(iii) Destroy discarded objects like old tyres and bottles, as they collect and store\\nrain water.\\n(iv) Use mosquito repellents and wear long sleeved clothes to curtail exposure.\\n(v)\\nUse mosquito nets, also during daytime.\\n(vi) Avoid outdoor activities during dawn or dusk when these mosquitoes are most\\nactive.\\n(vii) Patients suffering from dengue fever must be isolated for at least 5 days.\\n(viii) Report to the nearest health centre for any suspected case of Dengue fever.\\nTreatment for dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever\\nThere is no specific treatment for dengue fever.

A\\npharmaceutical preparation or a naturally occurring substance used primarily to alter\\nthe physical or mental functioning of an individual, is called a drug.\\nWhat is drug abuse\\nWhen drugs are taken for medical reasons to treat or cure disease both physical\\nand mental, they are called medications or therapeutic drugs.\\nDrug abuse occurs when drugs are taken without medical reasons and without\\nmedical supervision, especially when they are taken in an amount, strength,\\nfrequency, or manner that damages the physical and mental functioning of the\\nindividual. Cough syrups, pain killers, and tranquillizers are some common medicines\\nthat are often abused.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 286\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nDrug abuse also occurs when certain chemicals that have no medical use or benefits\\nare taken, such as sniffing glue and solvents. The extent of drug abuse depends on\\nthe quantity of the drug being taken, and the method and frequency of its\\nconsumption. Drug abuse leads to many serious physical, emotional, and social\\nproblems.\\nWhat are the effects of drug abuse?\\nDrug abuse leads to a number of short-term and long-term effects that are\\ndetrimental to health:\\nz\\nShort-term effects : These are the effects that appear instantly or a few minutes\\nafter the intake of drugs. The effects include a sense of well-being and a pleasant\\ndrowsiness.\\nz\\nLong-term effects :  Constant and excessive use of drugs over a long period\\ncan cause both physical and mental damage and illness. This includes failure in\\nacademic studies, employment, and interpersonal relationship; financial ruin;\\nincreased risk of contracting STIs; and increased risk of being involved in\\nvehicular accidents. Addicts stop thinking of everything in life except when and\\nhow they will get their next drug dose. They will do anything for the dose,\\nincluding committing crimes such as theft and in certain case even murder.\\nSome Basic Facts\\nTeenagers sometimes try a smoke or drink just to see how it\\nfeels, but they do not start using drugs on a regular basis. What\\nis the harm in trying drugs just to see how it feels?\\nIdeally, there is no need to try out a smoke or drink.\\nBut there is a great difference between “ trying out” smoking  or\\ndrinking as compared to drugs.\\nSmoking and drinking once only or very occasionally does not\\nalways lead to addiction. But drugs are very powerful chemicals that\\ncan cause profound alterations in the metabolism of the  body and\\nin the chemistry of the brain. Even a single dose of a powerful drug\\ncan start the addiction process. When one’s mind and body becomes\\naddicted to drugs, stopping drugs produces very unpleasant and\\ndistressing mental and physical symptoms. This makes the addict\\npersist with the usage of the drug. Addicts cannot give up their habit\\nunless they get medical treatment and counselling.\\nYou should not boast about your strong will power and assume that\\nyou can experiment with drugs without becoming addicted. ALWAYS\\nKEEP AWAY from drugs. Do not allow yourself to succumb to\\npressure by friends and acquaintances.

The virus is present in the saliva of\\nthe rabid animals.\\nIndirect transmission\\nThe pathogens of certain diseases reach the human body through some intermediate\\nagents. It can take place by various means, which are as follows :\\n(i)\\nBy vectors such as houseflies, mosquitoes, and cockroaches. Examples:\\nHouseflies carry the causative organisms of cholera on their legs and mouth\\nparts from the faeces and sputum of infected persons to food and drinks and\\ncontaminate them. When this contaminated food is taken by a healthy person,\\nhe gets the infection. Similarly, mosquitoes carry virus of dengue and malarial\\nparasite which causes malaria.\\n(ii) Air-borne : The pathogens may reach humans with air and dust. The epidemic\\ntyphus spreads by inhalation of dried faeces of infected fly.\\n(iii) Object borne (Fonite borne) : Many diseases are transmitted through the use\\nof contaminated articles, such as clothes, utensils, toys, door handles, taps,\\nsyringes and surgical instruments.\\n(iv) Water borne : If potable water (drinking water) is contaminated with\\npathogens of diseases such as cholera, diarhhoea, hepatitis or jaundice, it\\nreaches a healthy person upon consuming such water.\\n29.2 SOME IMPORTANT TERMS TO REMEMBER\\nPathogen : A living organism which causes a disease.\\nParasite : An organism which gets food and shelter from host.\\nHost : The living body on or inside which the disease-producing organism takes\\nshelter.\\nInfestation : Presence of a large number of parasitic organisms on the surface of\\nbody of the host or on the clothings.\\nVector : It is an organism which harbours a pathogen and may pass it on to another\\nperson to cause a disease (Mosquitoes harbour malarial parasite and transmits it\\nto humans).\\nCarrier : It is an organism which itself does not harbour the pathogen but physically\\ntransmits it to another person (Housefly is the carrier of cholera germs).\\nReservoir : An organism which harbours pathogens in large numbers that do not\\ncause any suffering to it.\\nEpidemic : Spreading of a disease among a large number of people causing a huge\\nloss of life in the same place for some time e.g. plague.\\nEndemic : A disease which is regularly found among a particular group of people\\ne.g. goitre, restricted to a certain locality or a country.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 268\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nPandemic : A disease which is found all over the world e.g. AIDS.\\nInterferon : Type of proteins produced by infected cells of the body when attacked\\nby a virus, which act to prevent the further development of the same virus.\\nInoculation : Introduction of antigenic material inside the body to prevent suffering\\nfrom a disease.\\nVaccination : Injection of a weak strain of a specific bacterium (Vaccine) in order\\nto secure immunity against the corresponding disease.

Influenza\\nInfluenza, commonly known as ‘flu’ is an illness caused by viruses that infect the\\nrespiratory tract. Compared to common cold, influenza is a more severe illness.\\nCauses\\nInfluenza is caused by a virus which attacks our body’s cells, resulting in various\\neffects depending on the strain of the virus.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\n 271\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nThere are many strains of influenza virus. The virus mutates all the time and new\\nvariations (strains) arise. This constant changing enables the virus to evade the\\nimmune system of its host. Unfortunately immunity against one strain (which is\\nconferred by exposure or immunisation) does not protect against other strains. A\\nperson infected with influenza virus develops antibodies against that virus; as the\\nvirus changes, the antibodies against the virus do not recognize the changed virus,\\nand influenza can recur, caused by the changed or mutated virus.\\nSymptoms\\nTypical symptoms of influenza include:\\n(i)\\nfever (Usually 100° F to 103° F in adults and often even higher in children).\\n(ii) respiratory tract infection symptoms such as, cough, sore throat, running\\nnose, headache, pain in the muscles, and extreme fatigue.\\nAlthough nausea and vomiting and diarrhoea can sometimes accompany Influenza\\ninfection, especially in children, gastrointestinal symptoms are rarely prominent.\\nMost people who get flu, recover completely in 1 to 2 weeks, but some people\\ndevelop serious and potentially life-threatening complications, such as pneumonia.\\nTreatment and Control\\n(i) Much of the illness and death caused by influenza can be prevented by annual\\ninfluenza vaccination. Influenza vaccine is specifically recommended for those\\nwho are at high risk for complications with chronic diseases of the heart, lungs\\nor kidneys, diabetes, or severe forms of anaemia.\\n(ii) The persons suffering from influenza should\\nz\\ndrink plenty of fluids\\nz\\ntake symptom relief with paracetamol, aspirin (not in children under the\\nage of 16) or ibuprofen as recommended by the doctor.\\nz\\nConsult doctor immediately for treatment.\\n7. Dengue\\nDengue is an acute fever caused by virus. It is of two types: (i) Dengue fever, (ii)\\nDengue hemorrhagic fever.\\nDengue fever is characterized by an onset of sudden high fever, severe headache,\\npain behind the eyes and in the muscles and joints.\\nDengue hemorrhagic fever is an acute infectious viral disease. It is an advanced\\nstage of dengue fever. It is characterized by fever during the initial phase and other\\nsymptoms like headache, pain in the eye, joint pain and muscle pain, followed by\\nsigns of bleeding, red tiny spots on the skin, and bleeding from nose and gums.\\nHow does Dengue spread?\\nDengue spreads through the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito. The\\ntransmission of the disease occurs when a mosquito bites an infected person and\\nsubsequently bites a healthy person. In doing so, it transmits blood containing the'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 272\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nvirus to the healthy person and the person becomes infected with dengue. The first\\nsymptoms of the disease occur about 5 to 7 days after the infected bite.\\nAedes mosquito rests indoors, in closets and other dark places, and is active during\\nday time. Outside, it rests where it is cool and shaded. The female mosquito lays\\nher eggs in stagnant water containers such as coolers, tyres, empty buckets, in and\\naround homes, and other areas in towns or villages. These eggs become adults in\\nabout 10 days.\\nIncubation period\\nThe time between the bite of a mosquito carrying dengue virus and the start of\\nsymptoms averages 4 to 6 days, with a range of 3 to 14 days.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is made through blood tests by scanning for antibodies against dengue\\nviruses. In addition the blood platelet counts also get drastically reduced in the\\ninfected person.\\nSymptoms\\nSymptoms of Dengue fever\\n(i)\\nSudden onset of high fever, generally 104-105 °F (40 °C), which may last 4-\\n5 days.\\n(ii)\\nSevere headache mostly in the forehead.\\n(iii) pain in the joints and muscles, body aches.\\n(iv) Pain behind the eyes which worsens with eye movement.\\n(v)\\nNausea or vomiting.\\nSymptoms of Dengue hemorrhagic fever\\nThese include symptoms similar to dengue fever, plus other symptoms such as:\\n(i)\\nSevere and continuous pain in the abdomen.\\n(ii)\\nRashes on the skin.\\n(iii) Bleeding from the nose, mouth, or in the internal organs.\\n(iv) Frequent vomiting with or without blood.\\n(v)\\nBlack stools due to internal bleeding.\\n(vi) Excessive thirst (dry mouth).\\n(vii) Pale, cold skin, weakness.\\nPrevention\\nFollowing steps can be taken to prevent spread of dengue fever:\\n(i)\\nAvoid water stagnation for more than 72 hours so that the mosquitoes do not\\nbreed there.\\n(ii)\\nPrevent mosquito breeding in stored water bodies, like ponds, and wells.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\n 273\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\n(iii) Destroy discarded objects like old tyres and bottles, as they collect and store\\nrain water.\\n(iv) Use mosquito repellents and wear long sleeved clothes to curtail exposure.\\n(v)\\nUse mosquito nets, also during daytime.\\n(vi) Avoid outdoor activities during dawn or dusk when these mosquitoes are most\\nactive.\\n(vii) Patients suffering from dengue fever must be isolated for at least 5 days.\\n(viii) Report to the nearest health centre for any suspected case of Dengue fever.\\nTreatment for dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever\\nThere is no specific treatment for dengue fever. Persons with dengue fever should\\nrest and drink plenty of fluids. Dengue hemorrhagic fever is treated by replacing\\nlost fluids. Some patients need blood transfusions to control bleeding.\\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 29.2\\n1.

Cough syrups, pain killers, and tranquillizers are some common medicines\\nthat are often abused.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 286\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nDrug abuse also occurs when certain chemicals that have no medical use or benefits\\nare taken, such as sniffing glue and solvents. The extent of drug abuse depends on\\nthe quantity of the drug being taken, and the method and frequency of its\\nconsumption. Drug abuse leads to many serious physical, emotional, and social\\nproblems.\\nWhat are the effects of drug abuse?\\nDrug abuse leads to a number of short-term and long-term effects that are\\ndetrimental to health:\\nz\\nShort-term effects : These are the effects that appear instantly or a few minutes\\nafter the intake of drugs. The effects include a sense of well-being and a pleasant\\ndrowsiness.\\nz\\nLong-term effects :  Constant and excessive use of drugs over a long period\\ncan cause both physical and mental damage and illness. This includes failure in\\nacademic studies, employment, and interpersonal relationship; financial ruin;\\nincreased risk of contracting STIs; and increased risk of being involved in\\nvehicular accidents. Addicts stop thinking of everything in life except when and\\nhow they will get their next drug dose. They will do anything for the dose,\\nincluding committing crimes such as theft and in certain case even murder.\\nSome Basic Facts\\nTeenagers sometimes try a smoke or drink just to see how it\\nfeels, but they do not start using drugs on a regular basis. What\\nis the harm in trying drugs just to see how it feels?\\nIdeally, there is no need to try out a smoke or drink.\\nBut there is a great difference between “ trying out” smoking  or\\ndrinking as compared to drugs.\\nSmoking and drinking once only or very occasionally does not\\nalways lead to addiction. But drugs are very powerful chemicals that\\ncan cause profound alterations in the metabolism of the  body and\\nin the chemistry of the brain. Even a single dose of a powerful drug\\ncan start the addiction process. When one’s mind and body becomes\\naddicted to drugs, stopping drugs produces very unpleasant and\\ndistressing mental and physical symptoms. This makes the addict\\npersist with the usage of the drug. Addicts cannot give up their habit\\nunless they get medical treatment and counselling.\\nYou should not boast about your strong will power and assume that\\nyou can experiment with drugs without becoming addicted. ALWAYS\\nKEEP AWAY from drugs. Do not allow yourself to succumb to\\npressure by friends and acquaintances.

By\\ninhaling the air containing the droplets, a healthy person may get the infection.\\nDiseases like common cold, pneumonia, influenza, measles, tuberculosis and\\nwhooping cough spread through droplet infection.\\nCaused due to some specific factor,\\nsuch as malfunctioning of some vital\\norgan, and deficiency of nutrients.\\nDo not spread from one person to\\nanother by contact.\\nThe concern of the disease is restricted\\nto the individual only.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\n 267\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\n(iii) Contact with soil contaminated with disease-causing viruses and bacteria.\\n(iv) Animal bite : Viruses of rabies are introduced through the wound caused by\\nthe bite of rabid animals, especially dogs. The virus is present in the saliva of\\nthe rabid animals.\\nIndirect transmission\\nThe pathogens of certain diseases reach the human body through some intermediate\\nagents. It can take place by various means, which are as follows :\\n(i)\\nBy vectors such as houseflies, mosquitoes, and cockroaches. Examples:\\nHouseflies carry the causative organisms of cholera on their legs and mouth\\nparts from the faeces and sputum of infected persons to food and drinks and\\ncontaminate them. When this contaminated food is taken by a healthy person,\\nhe gets the infection. Similarly, mosquitoes carry virus of dengue and malarial\\nparasite which causes malaria.\\n(ii) Air-borne : The pathogens may reach humans with air and dust. The epidemic\\ntyphus spreads by inhalation of dried faeces of infected fly.\\n(iii) Object borne (Fonite borne) : Many diseases are transmitted through the use\\nof contaminated articles, such as clothes, utensils, toys, door handles, taps,\\nsyringes and surgical instruments.\\n(iv) Water borne : If potable water (drinking water) is contaminated with\\npathogens of diseases such as cholera, diarhhoea, hepatitis or jaundice, it\\nreaches a healthy person upon consuming such water.\\n29.2 SOME IMPORTANT TERMS TO REMEMBER\\nPathogen : A living organism which causes a disease.\\nParasite : An organism which gets food and shelter from host.\\nHost : The living body on or inside which the disease-producing organism takes\\nshelter.\\nInfestation : Presence of a large number of parasitic organisms on the surface of\\nbody of the host or on the clothings.\\nVector : It is an organism which harbours a pathogen and may pass it on to another\\nperson to cause a disease (Mosquitoes harbour malarial parasite and transmits it\\nto humans).\\nCarrier : It is an organism which itself does not harbour the pathogen but physically\\ntransmits it to another person (Housefly is the carrier of cholera germs).\\nReservoir : An organism which harbours pathogens in large numbers that do not\\ncause any suffering to it.\\nEpidemic : Spreading of a disease among a large number of people causing a huge\\nloss of life in the same place for some time e.g. plague.\\nEndemic : A disease which is regularly found among a particular group of people\\ne.g. goitre, restricted to a certain locality or a country.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 268\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nPandemic : A disease which is found all over the world e.g. AIDS.\\nInterferon : Type of proteins produced by infected cells of the body when attacked\\nby a virus, which act to prevent the further development of the same virus.\\nInoculation : Introduction of antigenic material inside the body to prevent suffering\\nfrom a disease.\\nVaccination : Injection of a weak strain of a specific bacterium (Vaccine) in order\\nto secure immunity against the corresponding disease.

The virus mutates all the time and new\\nvariations (strains) arise. This constant changing enables the virus to evade the\\nimmune system of its host. Unfortunately immunity against one strain (which is\\nconferred by exposure or immunisation) does not protect against other strains. A\\nperson infected with influenza virus develops antibodies against that virus; as the\\nvirus changes, the antibodies against the virus do not recognize the changed virus,\\nand influenza can recur, caused by the changed or mutated virus.\\nSymptoms\\nTypical symptoms of influenza include:\\n(i)\\nfever (Usually 100° F to 103° F in adults and often even higher in children).\\n(ii) respiratory tract infection symptoms such as, cough, sore throat, running\\nnose, headache, pain in the muscles, and extreme fatigue.\\nAlthough nausea and vomiting and diarrhoea can sometimes accompany Influenza\\ninfection, especially in children, gastrointestinal symptoms are rarely prominent.\\nMost people who get flu, recover completely in 1 to 2 weeks, but some people\\ndevelop serious and potentially life-threatening complications, such as pneumonia.\\nTreatment and Control\\n(i) Much of the illness and death caused by influenza can be prevented by annual\\ninfluenza vaccination. Influenza vaccine is specifically recommended for those\\nwho are at high risk for complications with chronic diseases of the heart, lungs\\nor kidneys, diabetes, or severe forms of anaemia.\\n(ii) The persons suffering from influenza should\\nz\\ndrink plenty of fluids\\nz\\ntake symptom relief with paracetamol, aspirin (not in children under the\\nage of 16) or ibuprofen as recommended by the doctor.\\nz\\nConsult doctor immediately for treatment.\\n7. Dengue\\nDengue is an acute fever caused by virus. It is of two types: (i) Dengue fever, (ii)\\nDengue hemorrhagic fever.\\nDengue fever is characterized by an onset of sudden high fever, severe headache,\\npain behind the eyes and in the muscles and joints.\\nDengue hemorrhagic fever is an acute infectious viral disease. It is an advanced\\nstage of dengue fever. It is characterized by fever during the initial phase and other\\nsymptoms like headache, pain in the eye, joint pain and muscle pain, followed by\\nsigns of bleeding, red tiny spots on the skin, and bleeding from nose and gums.\\nHow does Dengue spread?\\nDengue spreads through the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito. The\\ntransmission of the disease occurs when a mosquito bites an infected person and\\nsubsequently bites a healthy person. In doing so, it transmits blood containing the'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 272\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nvirus to the healthy person and the person becomes infected with dengue. The first\\nsymptoms of the disease occur about 5 to 7 days after the infected bite.\\nAedes mosquito rests indoors, in closets and other dark places, and is active during\\nday time. Outside, it rests where it is cool and shaded. The female mosquito lays\\nher eggs in stagnant water containers such as coolers, tyres, empty buckets, in and\\naround homes, and other areas in towns or villages. These eggs become adults in\\nabout 10 days.\\nIncubation period\\nThe time between the bite of a mosquito carrying dengue virus and the start of\\nsymptoms averages 4 to 6 days, with a range of 3 to 14 days.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is made through blood tests by scanning for antibodies against dengue\\nviruses. In addition the blood platelet counts also get drastically reduced in the\\ninfected person.\\nSymptoms\\nSymptoms of Dengue fever\\n(i)\\nSudden onset of high fever, generally 104-105 °F (40 °C), which may last 4-\\n5 days.\\n(ii)\\nSevere headache mostly in the forehead.\\n(iii) pain in the joints and muscles, body aches.\\n(iv) Pain behind the eyes which worsens with eye movement.\\n(v)\\nNausea or vomiting.\\nSymptoms of Dengue hemorrhagic fever\\nThese include symptoms similar to dengue fever, plus other symptoms such as:\\n(i)\\nSevere and continuous pain in the abdomen.\\n(ii)\\nRashes on the skin.\\n(iii) Bleeding from the nose, mouth, or in the internal organs.\\n(iv) Frequent vomiting with or without blood.\\n(v)\\nBlack stools due to internal bleeding.\\n(vi) Excessive thirst (dry mouth).\\n(vii) Pale, cold skin, weakness.\\nPrevention\\nFollowing steps can be taken to prevent spread of dengue fever:\\n(i)\\nAvoid water stagnation for more than 72 hours so that the mosquitoes do not\\nbreed there.\\n(ii)\\nPrevent mosquito breeding in stored water bodies, like ponds, and wells.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\n 273\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\n(iii) Destroy discarded objects like old tyres and bottles, as they collect and store\\nrain water.\\n(iv) Use mosquito repellents and wear long sleeved clothes to curtail exposure.\\n(v)\\nUse mosquito nets, also during daytime.\\n(vi) Avoid outdoor activities during dawn or dusk when these mosquitoes are most\\nactive.\\n(vii) Patients suffering from dengue fever must be isolated for at least 5 days.\\n(viii) Report to the nearest health centre for any suspected case of Dengue fever.\\nTreatment for dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever\\nThere is no specific treatment for dengue fever.

Cough syrups, pain killers, and tranquillizers are some common medicines\\nthat are often abused.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 286\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nDrug abuse also occurs when certain chemicals that have no medical use or benefits\\nare taken, such as sniffing glue and solvents. The extent of drug abuse depends on\\nthe quantity of the drug being taken, and the method and frequency of its\\nconsumption. Drug abuse leads to many serious physical, emotional, and social\\nproblems.\\nWhat are the effects of drug abuse?\\nDrug abuse leads to a number of short-term and long-term effects that are\\ndetrimental to health:\\nz\\nShort-term effects : These are the effects that appear instantly or a few minutes\\nafter the intake of drugs. The effects include a sense of well-being and a pleasant\\ndrowsiness.\\nz\\nLong-term effects :  Constant and excessive use of drugs over a long period\\ncan cause both physical and mental damage and illness. This includes failure in\\nacademic studies, employment, and interpersonal relationship; financial ruin;\\nincreased risk of contracting STIs; and increased risk of being involved in\\nvehicular accidents. Addicts stop thinking of everything in life except when and\\nhow they will get their next drug dose. They will do anything for the dose,\\nincluding committing crimes such as theft and in certain case even murder.\\nSome Basic Facts\\nTeenagers sometimes try a smoke or drink just to see how it\\nfeels, but they do not start using drugs on a regular basis. What\\nis the harm in trying drugs just to see how it feels?\\nIdeally, there is no need to try out a smoke or drink.\\nBut there is a great difference between “ trying out” smoking  or\\ndrinking as compared to drugs.\\nSmoking and drinking once only or very occasionally does not\\nalways lead to addiction. But drugs are very powerful chemicals that\\ncan cause profound alterations in the metabolism of the  body and\\nin the chemistry of the brain. Even a single dose of a powerful drug\\ncan start the addiction process. When one’s mind and body becomes\\naddicted to drugs, stopping drugs produces very unpleasant and\\ndistressing mental and physical symptoms. This makes the addict\\npersist with the usage of the drug. Addicts cannot give up their habit\\nunless they get medical treatment and counselling.\\nYou should not boast about your strong will power and assume that\\nyou can experiment with drugs without becoming addicted.

The virus is present in the saliva of\\nthe rabid animals.\\nIndirect transmission\\nThe pathogens of certain diseases reach the human body through some intermediate\\nagents. It can take place by various means, which are as follows :\\n(i)\\nBy vectors such as houseflies, mosquitoes, and cockroaches. Examples:\\nHouseflies carry the causative organisms of cholera on their legs and mouth\\nparts from the faeces and sputum of infected persons to food and drinks and\\ncontaminate them.

The virus mutates all the time and new\\nvariations (strains) arise. This constant changing enables the virus to evade the\\nimmune system of its host. Unfortunately immunity against one strain (which is\\nconferred by exposure or immunisation) does not protect against other strains. A\\nperson infected with influenza virus develops antibodies against that virus; as the\\nvirus changes, the antibodies against the virus do not recognize the changed virus,\\nand influenza can recur, caused by the changed or mutated virus.\\nSymptoms\\nTypical symptoms of influenza include:\\n(i)\\nfever (Usually 100° F to 103° F in adults and often even higher in children).\\n(ii) respiratory tract infection symptoms such as, cough, sore throat, running\\nnose, headache, pain in the muscles, and extreme fatigue.\\nAlthough nausea and vomiting and diarrhoea can sometimes accompany Influenza\\ninfection, especially in children, gastrointestinal symptoms are rarely prominent.\\nMost people who get flu, recover completely in 1 to 2 weeks, but some people\\ndevelop serious and potentially life-threatening complications, such as pneumonia.\\nTreatment and Control\\n(i) Much of the illness and death caused by influenza can be prevented by annual\\ninfluenza vaccination. Influenza vaccine is specifically recommended for those\\nwho are at high risk for complications with chronic diseases of the heart, lungs\\nor kidneys, diabetes, or severe forms of anaemia.\\n(ii) The persons suffering from influenza should\\nz\\ndrink plenty of fluids\\nz\\ntake symptom relief with paracetamol, aspirin (not in children under the\\nage of 16) or ibuprofen as recommended by the doctor.\\nz\\nConsult doctor immediately for treatment.\\n7.

It is of two types: (i) Dengue fever, (ii)\\nDengue hemorrhagic fever.\\nDengue fever is characterized by an onset of sudden high fever, severe headache,\\npain behind the eyes and in the muscles and joints.\\nDengue hemorrhagic fever is an acute infectious viral disease. It is an advanced\\nstage of dengue fever. It is characterized by fever during the initial phase and other\\nsymptoms like headache, pain in the eye, joint pain and muscle pain, followed by\\nsigns of bleeding, red tiny spots on the skin, and bleeding from nose and gums.\\nHow does Dengue spread?\\nDengue spreads through the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito. The\\ntransmission of the disease occurs when a mosquito bites an infected person and\\nsubsequently bites a healthy person. In doing so, it transmits blood containing the'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 272\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nvirus to the healthy person and the person becomes infected with dengue. The first\\nsymptoms of the disease occur about 5 to 7 days after the infected bite.\\nAedes mosquito rests indoors, in closets and other dark places, and is active during\\nday time. Outside, it rests where it is cool and shaded. The female mosquito lays\\nher eggs in stagnant water containers such as coolers, tyres, empty buckets, in and\\naround homes, and other areas in towns or villages. These eggs become adults in\\nabout 10 days.\\nIncubation period\\nThe time between the bite of a mosquito carrying dengue virus and the start of\\nsymptoms averages 4 to 6 days, with a range of 3 to 14 days.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is made through blood tests by scanning for antibodies against dengue\\nviruses. In addition the blood platelet counts also get drastically reduced in the\\ninfected person.\\nSymptoms\\nSymptoms of Dengue fever\\n(i)\\nSudden onset of high fever, generally 104-105 °F (40 °C), which may last 4-\\n5 days.\\n(ii)\\nSevere headache mostly in the forehead.\\n(iii) pain in the joints and muscles, body aches.\\n(iv) Pain behind the eyes which worsens with eye movement.\\n(v)\\nNausea or vomiting.\\nSymptoms of Dengue hemorrhagic fever\\nThese include symptoms similar to dengue fever, plus other symptoms such as:\\n(i)\\nSevere and continuous pain in the abdomen.\\n(ii)\\nRashes on the skin.\\n(iii) Bleeding from the nose, mouth, or in the internal organs.\\n(iv) Frequent vomiting with or without blood.\\n(v)\\nBlack stools due to internal bleeding.\\n(vi) Excessive thirst (dry mouth).\\n(vii) Pale, cold skin, weakness.\\nPrevention\\nFollowing steps can be taken to prevent spread of dengue fever:\\n(i)\\nAvoid water stagnation for more than 72 hours so that the mosquitoes do not\\nbreed there.\\n(ii)\\nPrevent mosquito breeding in stored water bodies, like ponds, and wells.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\n 273\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\n(iii) Destroy discarded objects like old tyres and bottles, as they collect and store\\nrain water.\\n(iv) Use mosquito repellents and wear long sleeved clothes to curtail exposure.\\n(v)\\nUse mosquito nets, also during daytime.\\n(vi) Avoid outdoor activities during dawn or dusk when these mosquitoes are most\\nactive.\\n(vii) Patients suffering from dengue fever must be isolated for at least 5 days.\\n(viii) Report to the nearest health centre for any suspected case of Dengue fever.\\nTreatment for dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever\\nThere is no specific treatment for dengue fever.

A\\npharmaceutical preparation or a naturally occurring substance used primarily to alter\\nthe physical or mental functioning of an individual, is called a drug.\\nWhat is drug abuse\\nWhen drugs are taken for medical reasons to treat or cure disease both physical\\nand mental, they are called medications or therapeutic drugs.\\nDrug abuse occurs when drugs are taken without medical reasons and without\\nmedical supervision, especially when they are taken in an amount, strength,\\nfrequency, or manner that damages the physical and mental functioning of the\\nindividual. Cough syrups, pain killers, and tranquillizers are some common medicines\\nthat are often abused.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 286\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nDrug abuse also occurs when certain chemicals that have no medical use or benefits\\nare taken, such as sniffing glue and solvents. The extent of drug abuse depends on\\nthe quantity of the drug being taken, and the method and frequency of its\\nconsumption. Drug abuse leads to many serious physical, emotional, and social\\nproblems.\\nWhat are the effects of drug abuse?\\nDrug abuse leads to a number of short-term and long-term effects that are\\ndetrimental to health:\\nz\\nShort-term effects : These are the effects that appear instantly or a few minutes\\nafter the intake of drugs. The effects include a sense of well-being and a pleasant\\ndrowsiness.\\nz\\nLong-term effects :  Constant and excessive use of drugs over a long period\\ncan cause both physical and mental damage and illness. This includes failure in\\nacademic studies, employment, and interpersonal relationship; financial ruin;\\nincreased risk of contracting STIs; and increased risk of being involved in\\nvehicular accidents. Addicts stop thinking of everything in life except when and\\nhow they will get their next drug dose. They will do anything for the dose,\\nincluding committing crimes such as theft and in certain case even murder.\\nSome Basic Facts\\nTeenagers sometimes try a smoke or drink just to see how it\\nfeels, but they do not start using drugs on a regular basis. What\\nis the harm in trying drugs just to see how it feels?\\nIdeally, there is no need to try out a smoke or drink.\\nBut there is a great difference between “ trying out” smoking  or\\ndrinking as compared to drugs.\\nSmoking and drinking once only or very occasionally does not\\nalways lead to addiction. But drugs are very powerful chemicals that\\ncan cause profound alterations in the metabolism of the  body and\\nin the chemistry of the brain. Even a single dose of a powerful drug\\ncan start the addiction process. When one’s mind and body becomes\\naddicted to drugs, stopping drugs produces very unpleasant and\\ndistressing mental and physical symptoms. This makes the addict\\npersist with the usage of the drug. Addicts cannot give up their habit\\nunless they get medical treatment and counselling.\\nYou should not boast about your strong will power and assume that\\nyou can experiment with drugs without becoming addicted. ALWAYS\\nKEEP AWAY from drugs. Do not allow yourself to succumb to\\npressure by friends and acquaintances.

It can take place by various means such as,\\n(i)\\nDirect contact between the infected person and the healthy person :\\nDiseases like small pox, chicken pox, syphilis, gonorrhoea spread through direct\\ncontact.\\n(ii) Droplet infection : The infected person throws out tiny droplets of mucus by\\ncoughing, sneezing or spitting. These droplets may contain the pathogen. By\\ninhaling the air containing the droplets, a healthy person may get the infection.\\nDiseases like common cold, pneumonia, influenza, measles, tuberculosis and\\nwhooping cough spread through droplet infection.\\nCaused due to some specific factor,\\nsuch as malfunctioning of some vital\\norgan, and deficiency of nutrients.\\nDo not spread from one person to\\nanother by contact.\\nThe concern of the disease is restricted\\nto the individual only.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\n 267\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\n(iii) Contact with soil contaminated with disease-causing viruses and bacteria.\\n(iv) Animal bite : Viruses of rabies are introduced through the wound caused by\\nthe bite of rabid animals, especially dogs. The virus is present in the saliva of\\nthe rabid animals.\\nIndirect transmission\\nThe pathogens of certain diseases reach the human body through some intermediate\\nagents. It can take place by various means, which are as follows :\\n(i)\\nBy vectors such as houseflies, mosquitoes, and cockroaches. Examples:\\nHouseflies carry the causative organisms of cholera on their legs and mouth\\nparts from the faeces and sputum of infected persons to food and drinks and\\ncontaminate them. When this contaminated food is taken by a healthy person,\\nhe gets the infection. Similarly, mosquitoes carry virus of dengue and malarial\\nparasite which causes malaria.\\n(ii) Air-borne : The pathogens may reach humans with air and dust. The epidemic\\ntyphus spreads by inhalation of dried faeces of infected fly.\\n(iii) Object borne (Fonite borne) : Many diseases are transmitted through the use\\nof contaminated articles, such as clothes, utensils, toys, door handles, taps,\\nsyringes and surgical instruments.\\n(iv) Water borne : If potable water (drinking water) is contaminated with\\npathogens of diseases such as cholera, diarhhoea, hepatitis or jaundice, it\\nreaches a healthy person upon consuming such water.\\n29.2 SOME IMPORTANT TERMS TO REMEMBER\\nPathogen : A living organism which causes a disease.\\nParasite : An organism which gets food and shelter from host.\\nHost : The living body on or inside which the disease-producing organism takes\\nshelter.\\nInfestation : Presence of a large number of parasitic organisms on the surface of\\nbody of the host or on the clothings.\\nVector : It is an organism which harbours a pathogen and may pass it on to another\\nperson to cause a disease (Mosquitoes harbour malarial parasite and transmits it\\nto humans).\\nCarrier : It is an organism which itself does not harbour the pathogen but physically\\ntransmits it to another person (Housefly is the carrier of cholera germs).\\nReservoir : An organism which harbours pathogens in large numbers that do not\\ncause any suffering to it.\\nEpidemic : Spreading of a disease among a large number of people causing a huge\\nloss of life in the same place for some time e.g. plague.\\nEndemic : A disease which is regularly found among a particular group of people\\ne.g. goitre, restricted to a certain locality or a country.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 268\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nPandemic : A disease which is found all over the world e.g. AIDS.\\nInterferon : Type of proteins produced by infected cells of the body when attacked\\nby a virus, which act to prevent the further development of the same virus.\\nInoculation : Introduction of antigenic material inside the body to prevent suffering\\nfrom a disease.\\nVaccination : Injection of a weak strain of a specific bacterium (Vaccine) in order\\nto secure immunity against the corresponding disease.

The virus mutates all the time and new\\nvariations (strains) arise. This constant changing enables the virus to evade the\\nimmune system of its host. Unfortunately immunity against one strain (which is\\nconferred by exposure or immunisation) does not protect against other strains. A\\nperson infected with influenza virus develops antibodies against that virus; as the\\nvirus changes, the antibodies against the virus do not recognize the changed virus,\\nand influenza can recur, caused by the changed or mutated virus.\\nSymptoms\\nTypical symptoms of influenza include:\\n(i)\\nfever (Usually 100° F to 103° F in adults and often even higher in children).\\n(ii) respiratory tract infection symptoms such as, cough, sore throat, running\\nnose, headache, pain in the muscles, and extreme fatigue.\\nAlthough nausea and vomiting and diarrhoea can sometimes accompany Influenza\\ninfection, especially in children, gastrointestinal symptoms are rarely prominent.\\nMost people who get flu, recover completely in 1 to 2 weeks, but some people\\ndevelop serious and potentially life-threatening complications, such as pneumonia.\\nTreatment and Control\\n(i) Much of the illness and death caused by influenza can be prevented by annual\\ninfluenza vaccination.

Dengue\\nDengue is an acute fever caused by virus. It is of two types: (i) Dengue fever, (ii)\\nDengue hemorrhagic fever.\\nDengue fever is characterized by an onset of sudden high fever, severe headache,\\npain behind the eyes and in the muscles and joints.\\nDengue hemorrhagic fever is an acute infectious viral disease. It is an advanced\\nstage of dengue fever. It is characterized by fever during the initial phase and other\\nsymptoms like headache, pain in the eye, joint pain and muscle pain, followed by\\nsigns of bleeding, red tiny spots on the skin, and bleeding from nose and gums.\\nHow does Dengue spread?\\nDengue spreads through the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito. The\\ntransmission of the disease occurs when a mosquito bites an infected person and\\nsubsequently bites a healthy person. In doing so, it transmits blood containing the'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 272\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nvirus to the healthy person and the person becomes infected with dengue. The first\\nsymptoms of the disease occur about 5 to 7 days after the infected bite.\\nAedes mosquito rests indoors, in closets and other dark places, and is active during\\nday time. Outside, it rests where it is cool and shaded. The female mosquito lays\\nher eggs in stagnant water containers such as coolers, tyres, empty buckets, in and\\naround homes, and other areas in towns or villages. These eggs become adults in\\nabout 10 days.\\nIncubation period\\nThe time between the bite of a mosquito carrying dengue virus and the start of\\nsymptoms averages 4 to 6 days, with a range of 3 to 14 days.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is made through blood tests by scanning for antibodies against dengue\\nviruses. In addition the blood platelet counts also get drastically reduced in the\\ninfected person.\\nSymptoms\\nSymptoms of Dengue fever\\n(i)\\nSudden onset of high fever, generally 104-105 °F (40 °C), which may last 4-\\n5 days.\\n(ii)\\nSevere headache mostly in the forehead.\\n(iii) pain in the joints and muscles, body aches.\\n(iv) Pain behind the eyes which worsens with eye movement.\\n(v)\\nNausea or vomiting.\\nSymptoms of Dengue hemorrhagic fever\\nThese include symptoms similar to dengue fever, plus other symptoms such as:\\n(i)\\nSevere and continuous pain in the abdomen.\\n(ii)\\nRashes on the skin.\\n(iii) Bleeding from the nose, mouth, or in the internal organs.\\n(iv) Frequent vomiting with or without blood.\\n(v)\\nBlack stools due to internal bleeding.\\n(vi) Excessive thirst (dry mouth).\\n(vii) Pale, cold skin, weakness.\\nPrevention\\nFollowing steps can be taken to prevent spread of dengue fever:\\n(i)\\nAvoid water stagnation for more than 72 hours so that the mosquitoes do not\\nbreed there.\\n(ii)\\nPrevent mosquito breeding in stored water bodies, like ponds, and wells.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\n 273\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\n(iii) Destroy discarded objects like old tyres and bottles, as they collect and store\\nrain water.\\n(iv) Use mosquito repellents and wear long sleeved clothes to curtail exposure.\\n(v)\\nUse mosquito nets, also during daytime.\\n(vi) Avoid outdoor activities during dawn or dusk when these mosquitoes are most\\nactive.\\n(vii) Patients suffering from dengue fever must be isolated for at least 5 days.\\n(viii) Report to the nearest health centre for any suspected case of Dengue fever.\\nTreatment for dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever\\nThere is no specific treatment for dengue fever.

The extent of drug abuse depends on\\nthe quantity of the drug being taken, and the method and frequency of its\\nconsumption. Drug abuse leads to many serious physical, emotional, and social\\nproblems.\\nWhat are the effects of drug abuse?\\nDrug abuse leads to a number of short-term and long-term effects that are\\ndetrimental to health:\\nz\\nShort-term effects : These are the effects that appear instantly or a few minutes\\nafter the intake of drugs. The effects include a sense of well-being and a pleasant\\ndrowsiness.\\nz\\nLong-term effects :  Constant and excessive use of drugs over a long period\\ncan cause both physical and mental damage and illness. This includes failure in\\nacademic studies, employment, and interpersonal relationship; financial ruin;\\nincreased risk of contracting STIs; and increased risk of being involved in\\nvehicular accidents. Addicts stop thinking of everything in life except when and\\nhow they will get their next drug dose. They will do anything for the dose,\\nincluding committing crimes such as theft and in certain case even murder.\\nSome Basic Facts\\nTeenagers sometimes try a smoke or drink just to see how it\\nfeels, but they do not start using drugs on a regular basis. What\\nis the harm in trying drugs just to see how it feels?\\nIdeally, there is no need to try out a smoke or drink.\\nBut there is a great difference between “ trying out” smoking  or\\ndrinking as compared to drugs.\\nSmoking and drinking once only or very occasionally does not\\nalways lead to addiction. But drugs are very powerful chemicals that\\ncan cause profound alterations in the metabolism of the  body and\\nin the chemistry of the brain. Even a single dose of a powerful drug\\ncan start the addiction process. When one’s mind and body becomes\\naddicted to drugs, stopping drugs produces very unpleasant and\\ndistressing mental and physical symptoms. This makes the addict\\npersist with the usage of the drug. Addicts cannot give up their habit\\nunless they get medical treatment and counselling.\\nYou should not boast about your strong will power and assume that\\nyou can experiment with drugs without becoming addicted.

The virus is present in the saliva of\\nthe rabid animals.\\nIndirect transmission\\nThe pathogens of certain diseases reach the human body through some intermediate\\nagents. It can take place by various means, which are as follows :\\n(i)\\nBy vectors such as houseflies, mosquitoes, and cockroaches. Examples:\\nHouseflies carry the causative organisms of cholera on their legs and mouth\\nparts from the faeces and sputum of infected persons to food and drinks and\\ncontaminate them. When this contaminated food is taken by a healthy person,\\nhe gets the infection. Similarly, mosquitoes carry virus of dengue and malarial\\nparasite which causes malaria.\\n(ii) Air-borne : The pathogens may reach humans with air and dust. The epidemic\\ntyphus spreads by inhalation of dried faeces of infected fly.\\n(iii) Object borne (Fonite borne) : Many diseases are transmitted through the use\\nof contaminated articles, such as clothes, utensils, toys, door handles, taps,\\nsyringes and surgical instruments.\\n(iv) Water borne : If potable water (drinking water) is contaminated with\\npathogens of diseases such as cholera, diarhhoea, hepatitis or jaundice, it\\nreaches a healthy person upon consuming such water.\\n29.2 SOME IMPORTANT TERMS TO REMEMBER\\nPathogen : A living organism which causes a disease.\\nParasite : An organism which gets food and shelter from host.\\nHost : The living body on or inside which the disease-producing organism takes\\nshelter.\\nInfestation : Presence of a large number of parasitic organisms on the surface of\\nbody of the host or on the clothings.\\nVector : It is an organism which harbours a pathogen and may pass it on to another\\nperson to cause a disease (Mosquitoes harbour malarial parasite and transmits it\\nto humans).\\nCarrier : It is an organism which itself does not harbour the pathogen but physically\\ntransmits it to another person (Housefly is the carrier of cholera germs).\\nReservoir : An organism which harbours pathogens in large numbers that do not\\ncause any suffering to it.\\nEpidemic : Spreading of a disease among a large number of people causing a huge\\nloss of life in the same place for some time e.g. plague.\\nEndemic : A disease which is regularly found among a particular group of people\\ne.g. goitre, restricted to a certain locality or a country.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 268\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nPandemic : A disease which is found all over the world e.g. AIDS.\\nInterferon : Type of proteins produced by infected cells of the body when attacked\\nby a virus, which act to prevent the further development of the same virus.\\nInoculation : Introduction of antigenic material inside the body to prevent suffering\\nfrom a disease.\\nVaccination : Injection of a weak strain of a specific bacterium (Vaccine) in order\\nto secure immunity against the corresponding disease.

The virus mutates all the time and new\\nvariations (strains) arise. This constant changing enables the virus to evade the\\nimmune system of its host. Unfortunately immunity against one strain (which is\\nconferred by exposure or immunisation) does not protect against other strains. A\\nperson infected with influenza virus develops antibodies against that virus; as the\\nvirus changes, the antibodies against the virus do not recognize the changed virus,\\nand influenza can recur, caused by the changed or mutated virus.\\nSymptoms\\nTypical symptoms of influenza include:\\n(i)\\nfever (Usually 100° F to 103° F in adults and often even higher in children).\\n(ii) respiratory tract infection symptoms such as, cough, sore throat, running\\nnose, headache, pain in the muscles, and extreme fatigue.\\nAlthough nausea and vomiting and diarrhoea can sometimes accompany Influenza\\ninfection, especially in children, gastrointestinal symptoms are rarely prominent.\\nMost people who get flu, recover completely in 1 to 2 weeks, but some people\\ndevelop serious and potentially life-threatening complications, such as pneumonia.\\nTreatment and Control\\n(i) Much of the illness and death caused by influenza can be prevented by annual\\ninfluenza vaccination. Influenza vaccine is specifically recommended for those\\nwho are at high risk for complications with chronic diseases of the heart, lungs\\nor kidneys, diabetes, or severe forms of anaemia.\\n(ii) The persons suffering from influenza should\\nz\\ndrink plenty of fluids\\nz\\ntake symptom relief with paracetamol, aspirin (not in children under the\\nage of 16) or ibuprofen as recommended by the doctor.\\nz\\nConsult doctor immediately for treatment.\\n7. Dengue\\nDengue is an acute fever caused by virus. It is of two types: (i) Dengue fever, (ii)\\nDengue hemorrhagic fever.\\nDengue fever is characterized by an onset of sudden high fever, severe headache,\\npain behind the eyes and in the muscles and joints.\\nDengue hemorrhagic fever is an acute infectious viral disease. It is an advanced\\nstage of dengue fever. It is characterized by fever during the initial phase and other\\nsymptoms like headache, pain in the eye, joint pain and muscle pain, followed by\\nsigns of bleeding, red tiny spots on the skin, and bleeding from nose and gums.\\nHow does Dengue spread?\\nDengue spreads through the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito. The\\ntransmission of the disease occurs when a mosquito bites an infected person and\\nsubsequently bites a healthy person. In doing so, it transmits blood containing the'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 272\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nvirus to the healthy person and the person becomes infected with dengue. The first\\nsymptoms of the disease occur about 5 to 7 days after the infected bite.\\nAedes mosquito rests indoors, in closets and other dark places, and is active during\\nday time. Outside, it rests where it is cool and shaded. The female mosquito lays\\nher eggs in stagnant water containers such as coolers, tyres, empty buckets, in and\\naround homes, and other areas in towns or villages. These eggs become adults in\\nabout 10 days.\\nIncubation period\\nThe time between the bite of a mosquito carrying dengue virus and the start of\\nsymptoms averages 4 to 6 days, with a range of 3 to 14 days.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is made through blood tests by scanning for antibodies against dengue\\nviruses. In addition the blood platelet counts also get drastically reduced in the\\ninfected person.\\nSymptoms\\nSymptoms of Dengue fever\\n(i)\\nSudden onset of high fever, generally 104-105 °F (40 °C), which may last 4-\\n5 days.\\n(ii)\\nSevere headache mostly in the forehead.\\n(iii) pain in the joints and muscles, body aches.\\n(iv) Pain behind the eyes which worsens with eye movement.\\n(v)\\nNausea or vomiting.\\nSymptoms of Dengue hemorrhagic fever\\nThese include symptoms similar to dengue fever, plus other symptoms such as:\\n(i)\\nSevere and continuous pain in the abdomen.\\n(ii)\\nRashes on the skin.\\n(iii) Bleeding from the nose, mouth, or in the internal organs.\\n(iv) Frequent vomiting with or without blood.\\n(v)\\nBlack stools due to internal bleeding.\\n(vi) Excessive thirst (dry mouth).\\n(vii) Pale, cold skin, weakness.\\nPrevention\\nFollowing steps can be taken to prevent spread of dengue fever:\\n(i)\\nAvoid water stagnation for more than 72 hours so that the mosquitoes do not\\nbreed there.\\n(ii)\\nPrevent mosquito breeding in stored water bodies, like ponds, and wells.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\n 273\\nBIOLOGY\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\n(iii) Destroy discarded objects like old tyres and bottles, as they collect and store\\nrain water.\\n(iv) Use mosquito repellents and wear long sleeved clothes to curtail exposure.\\n(v)\\nUse mosquito nets, also during daytime.\\n(vi) Avoid outdoor activities during dawn or dusk when these mosquitoes are most\\nactive.\\n(vii) Patients suffering from dengue fever must be isolated for at least 5 days.\\n(viii) Report to the nearest health centre for any suspected case of Dengue fever.\\nTreatment for dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever\\nThere is no specific treatment for dengue fever.

A\\npharmaceutical preparation or a naturally occurring substance used primarily to alter\\nthe physical or mental functioning of an individual, is called a drug.\\nWhat is drug abuse\\nWhen drugs are taken for medical reasons to treat or cure disease both physical\\nand mental, they are called medications or therapeutic drugs.\\nDrug abuse occurs when drugs are taken without medical reasons and without\\nmedical supervision, especially when they are taken in an amount, strength,\\nfrequency, or manner that damages the physical and mental functioning of the\\nindividual. Cough syrups, pain killers, and tranquillizers are some common medicines\\nthat are often abused.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 286\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nDrug abuse also occurs when certain chemicals that have no medical use or benefits\\nare taken, such as sniffing glue and solvents. The extent of drug abuse depends on\\nthe quantity of the drug being taken, and the method and frequency of its\\nconsumption. Drug abuse leads to many serious physical, emotional, and social\\nproblems.\\nWhat are the effects of drug abuse?\\nDrug abuse leads to a number of short-term and long-term effects that are\\ndetrimental to health:\\nz\\nShort-term effects : These are the effects that appear instantly or a few minutes\\nafter the intake of drugs. The effects include a sense of well-being and a pleasant\\ndrowsiness.\\nz\\nLong-term effects :  Constant and excessive use of drugs over a long period\\ncan cause both physical and mental damage and illness. This includes failure in\\nacademic studies, employment, and interpersonal relationship; financial ruin;\\nincreased risk of contracting STIs; and increased risk of being involved in\\nvehicular accidents. Addicts stop thinking of everything in life except when and\\nhow they will get their next drug dose. They will do anything for the dose,\\nincluding committing crimes such as theft and in certain case even murder.\\nSome Basic Facts\\nTeenagers sometimes try a smoke or drink just to see how it\\nfeels, but they do not start using drugs on a regular basis. What\\nis the harm in trying drugs just to see how it feels?\\nIdeally, there is no need to try out a smoke or drink.\\nBut there is a great difference between “ trying out” smoking  or\\ndrinking as compared to drugs.\\nSmoking and drinking once only or very occasionally does not\\nalways lead to addiction. But drugs are very powerful chemicals that\\ncan cause profound alterations in the metabolism of the  body and\\nin the chemistry of the brain. Even a single dose of a powerful drug\\ncan start the addiction process. When one’s mind and body becomes\\naddicted to drugs, stopping drugs produces very unpleasant and\\ndistressing mental and physical symptoms. This makes the addict\\npersist with the usage of the drug. Addicts cannot give up their habit\\nunless they get medical treatment and counselling.\\nYou should not boast about your strong will power and assume that\\nyou can experiment with drugs without becoming addicted. ALWAYS\\nKEEP AWAY from drugs. Do not allow yourself to succumb to\\npressure by friends and acquaintances.

It can take place by various means, which are as follows :\\n(i)\\nBy vectors such as houseflies, mosquitoes, and cockroaches. Examples:\\nHouseflies carry the causative organisms of cholera on their legs and mouth\\nparts from the faeces and sputum of infected persons to food and drinks and\\ncontaminate them. When this contaminated food is taken by a healthy person,\\nhe gets the infection. Similarly, mosquitoes carry virus of dengue and malarial\\nparasite which causes malaria.\\n(ii) Air-borne : The pathogens may reach humans with air and dust. The epidemic\\ntyphus spreads by inhalation of dried faeces of infected fly.\\n(iii) Object borne (Fonite borne) : Many diseases are transmitted through the use\\nof contaminated articles, such as clothes, utensils, toys, door handles, taps,\\nsyringes and surgical instruments.\\n(iv) Water borne : If potable water (drinking water) is contaminated with\\npathogens of diseases such as cholera, diarhhoea, hepatitis or jaundice, it\\nreaches a healthy person upon consuming such water.\\n29.2 SOME IMPORTANT TERMS TO REMEMBER\\nPathogen : A living organism which causes a disease.\\nParasite : An organism which gets food and shelter from host.\\nHost : The living body on or inside which the disease-producing organism takes\\nshelter.\\nInfestation : Presence of a large number of parasitic organisms on the surface of\\nbody of the host or on the clothings.\\nVector : It is an organism which harbours a pathogen and may pass it on to another\\nperson to cause a disease (Mosquitoes harbour malarial parasite and transmits it\\nto humans).\\nCarrier : It is an organism which itself does not harbour the pathogen but physically\\ntransmits it to another person (Housefly is the carrier of cholera germs).\\nReservoir : An organism which harbours pathogens in large numbers that do not\\ncause any suffering to it.\\nEpidemic : Spreading of a disease among a large number of people causing a huge\\nloss of life in the same place for some time e.g. plague.\\nEndemic : A disease which is regularly found among a particular group of people\\ne.g. goitre, restricted to a certain locality or a country.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 268\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nPandemic : A disease which is found all over the world e.g. AIDS.\\nInterferon : Type of proteins produced by infected cells of the body when attacked\\nby a virus, which act to prevent the further development of the same virus.\\nInoculation : Introduction of antigenic material inside the body to prevent suffering\\nfrom a disease.\\nVaccination : Injection of a weak strain of a specific bacterium (Vaccine) in order\\nto secure immunity against the corresponding disease.

The virus mutates all the time and new\\nvariations (strains) arise. This constant changing enables the virus to evade the\\nimmune system of its host. Unfortunately immunity against one strain (which is\\nconferred by exposure or immunisation) does not protect against other strains. A\\nperson infected with influenza virus develops antibodies against that virus; as the\\nvirus changes, the antibodies against the virus do not recognize the changed virus,\\nand influenza can recur, caused by the changed or mutated virus.\\nSymptoms\\nTypical symptoms of influenza include:\\n(i)\\nfever (Usually 100° F to 103° F in adults and often even higher in children).\\n(ii) respiratory tract infection symptoms such as, cough, sore throat, running\\nnose, headache, pain in the muscles, and extreme fatigue.\\nAlthough nausea and vomiting and diarrhoea can sometimes accompany Influenza\\ninfection, especially in children, gastrointestinal symptoms are rarely prominent.\\nMost people who get flu, recover completely in 1 to 2 weeks, but some people\\ndevelop serious and potentially life-threatening complications, such as pneumonia.\\nTreatment and Control\\n(i) Much of the illness and death caused by influenza can be prevented by annual\\ninfluenza vaccination. Influenza vaccine is specifically recommended for those\\nwho are at high risk for complications with chronic diseases of the heart, lungs\\nor kidneys, diabetes, or severe forms of anaemia.\\n(ii) The persons suffering from influenza should\\nz\\ndrink plenty of fluids\\nz\\ntake symptom relief with paracetamol, aspirin (not in children under the\\nage of 16) or ibuprofen as recommended by the doctor.\\nz\\nConsult doctor immediately for treatment.\\n7. Dengue\\nDengue is an acute fever caused by virus. It is of two types: (i) Dengue fever, (ii)\\nDengue hemorrhagic fever.\\nDengue fever is characterized by an onset of sudden high fever, severe headache,\\npain behind the eyes and in the muscles and joints.\\nDengue hemorrhagic fever is an acute infectious viral disease. It is an advanced\\nstage of dengue fever. It is characterized by fever during the initial phase and other\\nsymptoms like headache, pain in the eye, joint pain and muscle pain, followed by\\nsigns of bleeding, red tiny spots on the skin, and bleeding from nose and gums.\\nHow does Dengue spread?\\nDengue spreads through the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito. The\\ntransmission of the disease occurs when a mosquito bites an infected person and\\nsubsequently bites a healthy person. In doing so, it transmits blood containing the'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Some Common Human Diseases\\nBIOLOGY\\n 272\\nNotes\\nMODULE - 4\\nEnvironment and\\nHealth\\nvirus to the healthy person and the person becomes infected with dengue. The first\\nsymptoms of the disease occur about 5 to 7 days after the infected bite.\\nAedes mosquito rests indoors, in closets and other dark places, and is active during\\nday time. Outside, it rests where it is cool and shaded.

The extent of drug abuse depends on\\nthe quantity of the drug being taken, and the method and frequency of its\\nconsumption. Drug abuse leads to many serious physical, emotional, and social\\nproblems.\\nWhat are the effects of drug abuse?\\nDrug abuse leads to a number of short-term and long-term effects that are\\ndetrimental to health:\\nz\\nShort-term effects : These are the effects that appear instantly or a few minutes\\nafter the intake of drugs. The effects include a sense of well-being and a pleasant\\ndrowsiness.\\nz\\nLong-term effects :  Constant and excessive use of drugs over a long period\\ncan cause both physical and mental damage and illness. This includes failure in\\nacademic studies, employment, and interpersonal relationship; financial ruin;\\nincreased risk of contracting STIs; and increased risk of being involved in\\nvehicular accidents.

They will do anything for the dose,\\nincluding committing crimes such as theft and in certain case even murder.\\nSome Basic Facts\\nTeenagers sometimes try a smoke or drink just to see how it\\nfeels, but they do not start using drugs on a regular basis. What\\nis the harm in trying drugs just to see how it feels?\\nIdeally, there is no need to try out a smoke or drink.\\nBut there is a great difference between “ trying out” smoking  or\\ndrinking as compared to drugs.\\nSmoking and drinking once only or very occasionally does not\\nalways lead to addiction. But drugs are very powerful chemicals that\\ncan cause profound alterations in the metabolism of the  body and\\nin the chemistry of the brain. Even a single dose of a powerful drug\\ncan start the addiction process. When one’s mind and body becomes\\naddicted to drugs, stopping drugs produces very unpleasant and\\ndistressing mental and physical symptoms. This makes the addict\\npersist with the usage of the drug. Addicts cannot give up their habit\\nunless they get medical treatment and counselling.\\nYou should not boast about your strong will power and assume that\\nyou can experiment with drugs without becoming addicted.

      "{'summary': {'query_summary': 'Cancer is a complex and multifaceted disease characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells in the body. It occurs when genetic mutations or environmental factors disrupt the normal cellular processes, leading to the development of malignant tumors. These tumors can invade surrounding tissues, metastasize to other parts of the body, and disrupt normal organ function.\\n\\nThe process of cancer development, also known as carcinogenesis, involves multiple stages, including:\\n\\n1. Initiation: Genetic mutations or environmental factors trigger the transformation of normal cells into cancerous ones.\\n2. Promotion: The mutated cells undergo rapid division and growth, forming a tumor.\\n3. Progression: The tumor becomes more aggressive, invading surrounding tissues and potentially metastasizing to other parts of the body.\\n\\nImmunobiology, as mentioned in the provided module, plays a crucial role in understanding cancer. The immune system can recognize and attack cancer cells, but cancer often develops mechanisms to evade immune detection. Immunotherapy, a type of cancer treatment, aims to harness the power of the immune system to fight cancer.\\n\\nBiotechnology, another emerging area in biology, has led to significant advancements in cancer research and treatment. Techniques such as gene editing, stem cell therapy, and targeted therapies have improved our understanding of cancer biology and have paved the way for more effective treatments.\\n\\nWhile the provided module does not directly address the topic of cancer, the fields of biotechnology and immunobiology are essential in understanding the underlying biology of cancer and developing innovative treatments.'}}\n",
